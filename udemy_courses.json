    "long_desc": "DescriptionWelcome to Artificial Intelligence A-Z!Learn key AI concepts with intuition lectures to get you quickly up to speed with all things AI and practice them by building 7 different AIs:Build an AI with a Q-Learning model and train it to optimize warehouse flows in a Process Optimization case study.Build an AI with a Deep Q-Learning model and train it to land on the moon.Build an AI with a Deep Convolutional Q-Learning model and train it to play the game of Pac-Man.Build an AI with an A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) model and train it to fight Kung Fu.Build an AI with a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) model and train it for a Self-Driving Car.Build an AI with a SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) model and train it for a Self-Driving Car.Build an AI by fine-tuning a powerful pre-trained LLM (Llama 2 by Meta) with Hugging Face and re-train it to chat with you about medical terms. Simply put, we build here an AI Doctor Chatbot.But that's not all... Once you complete the course, you will get 3 extra AIs: DDPG, Full World Model, and Evolution Strategies & Genetic Algorithms. We build these AIs with ChatGPT for a Self-Driving Car and a Humanoid application. For each of these extra AIs you will get a long video lecture explaining the implementation, a mini PDF, and the Python code.Besides, you will get a free 3-hour extra course on Generative AI and LLMs with Cloud Computing as a Prize for completing the course.And last but not least, here is what you will get with this course:1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.2. Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates – We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.4. Real-world solutions – You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.5. In-course support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.So, are you ready to embrace the fascinating world of AI?Come join us, never stop learning, and enjoy AI!Who this course is for:Anyone interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or Deep LearningShow moreShow less",

In this course, you will learn the foundations of these groundbreaking applications.Welcome to Tensorflow 2.0!What an exciting time. It's been nearly 4 years since Tensorflow was released, and the library has evolved to its official second version.Tensorflow is Google's library for deep learning and artificial intelligence.Deep Learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as:Generating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (GANs)Beating world champions in the strategy game Go, and complex video games like CS:GO and Dota 2 (Deep Reinforcement Learning)Self-driving cars (Computer Vision)Speech recognition (e.g. Siri) and machine translation (Natural Language Processing)Even creating videos of people doing and saying things they never did (DeepFakes - a potentially nefarious application of deep learning)Tensorflow is the world's most popular library for deep learning, and it's built by Google, whose parent Alphabet recently became the most cash-rich company in the world (just a few days before I wrote this). It is the library of choice for many companies doing AI and machine learning.In other words, if you want to do deep learning, you gotta know Tensorflow.This course is for beginner-level students all the way up to expert-level students. How can this be?If you've just taken my free Numpy prerequisite, then you know everything you need to jump right in. We will start with some very basic machine learning models and advance to state of the art concepts.Along the way, you will learn about all of the major deep learning architectures, such as Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (image processing), and Recurrent Neural Networks (sequence data).Current projects include:Natural Language Processing (NLP)Recommender SystemsTransfer Learning for Computer VisionGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Deep Reinforcement Learning Stock Trading BotEven if you've taken all of my previous courses already, you will still learn about how to convert your previous code so that it uses Tensorflow 2.0, and there are all-new and never-before-seen projects in this course such as time series forecasting and how to do stock predictions.This course is designed for students who want to learn fast, but there are also \"in-depth\" sections in case you want to dig a little deeper into the theory (like what is a loss function, and what are the different types of gradient descent approaches).Advanced Tensorflow topics include:Deploying a model with Tensorflow Serving (Tensorflow in the cloud)Deploying a model with Tensorflow Lite (mobile and embedded applications)Distributed Tensorflow training with Distribution StrategiesWriting your own custom Tensorflow modelConverting Tensorflow 1.x code to Tensorflow 2.0Constants, Variables, and TensorsEager executionGradient tapeInstructor's Note: This course focuses on breadth rather than depth, with less theory in favor of building more cool stuff. If you are looking for a more theory-dense course, this is not it. Generally, for each of these topics (recommender systems, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, GANs, etc.) I already have courses singularly focused on those topics.Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you in class!WHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:Check out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)UNIQUE FEATURESEvery line of code explained in detail - email me any time if you disagreeNo wasted time \"typing\" on the keyboard like other courses - let's be honest, nobody can really write code worth learning about in just 20 minutes from scratchNot afraid of university-level math - get important details about algorithms that other courses leave outWho this course is for:Beginners to advanced students who want to learn about deep learning and AI in Tensorflow 2.0Show moreShow less",

The concept of Artificial Intelligence is used in sci-fiction movies to describe a virtual entity that crossed some critical threshold point and developed self-awareness. And like any good Hollywood movie, this entity will turn against humankind. OMG! It’s a great concept to fuel our basic survival fear; otherwise, no one will buy a ticket to the next Terminator movie ;-)As you may guess, things, in reality, are completely different. Artificial Intelligence is one of the biggest revolutions in the software industry. It is a mind-shift on how to develop software applications. Instead of using hard-coded rules for performing something, we let the machines learn things from data, decipher the complex patterns automatically, and then use it for multiple use cases.AI-Powered ApplicationsThere are growing amounts of AI-powered applications in a variety of practical use cases. Websites are using AI to better recommend visitors about products and services. The ability to recognize objects in real-time video streams is driven by machine learning. It is a game-changing technology, and the game just started.Simplifying ThingsThe concept of AI and ML can be a little bit intimidating for beginners, and specifically for people without a substantial background in complex math and programming. This training is a soft starting point to walk you through the fundamental theoretical concepts.We are going to open the mysterious AI/ML black box, and take a look inside, get more familiar with the terms being used in the industry. It is going to be a super interesting story. It is important to mention that there are no specific prerequisites for starting this training, and it is designed for absolute beginners.Would you like to join the upcoming Machine Learning revolution?Who this course is for:Anyone interested to get familiar with the AI/ML conceptsDevelopers curious about data scienceAI - Product Managers, Project Managers, EngineersData ScientistsShow moreShow less",

We learn about the term artificial intelligence and its origins. We then define the term in the current context.Once these basics are clear, we move on to Understand the various types of Artificial Intelligences like Regression, Classification and Clustering. We also look at reinforced learning and its uses. We talk about each of these in detail along with some real-life examples. We also Take a look back at some real-life artificial intelligence examples like a self-driving car and try to Segment the AI used in this into constituent components like regression classification and clustering.Once equipped with the basic understanding, we define the parts of Artificial Intelligence systems in detail and use real life examples to clarify concepts. The parts like input data, algorithm and output are pretty much common across artificial intelligence models. Having a clear understanding of these as well as their limitations is necessary for strong foundations in the subject.Finally, we develop our own usable AI models. These models are created using no-code method but are completely customizable. In fact, you can even download the code for the AI models that you have created and use it as you would like it. You will define the input, select the algorithm to be used and finally will also evaluate the output produced by the model.The models we create are:Image Detection ModelPose Detection ModelAudio Detection ModelThe course is supposed to be purchased by adults over the age of 18. In case kids want to enroll for the course, course must still be purchased by a parent or guardian and be watched under supervision.Who this course is for:This course has been developed for anyone who wants to get a basic understanding of what Artificial Intelligence is. It's ideal for anyone who has heard the term but doesn't really know what it entails.This course WILL NOT involve coding. You'll develop Artificial Intelligence models using your own dataset but without coding.Show moreShow less",

using a model trained on real-world data For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning modelWhat is machine learning used for?Machine learning is being applied to virtually every field today That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictionsDoes machine learning require coding?It's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systemsWhat are the limitations of Python?Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popularHow is Python used?Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications You can use Python to create desktop applications Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choices for developing web applications Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile developmentWhat jobs use Python?Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systemsHow do I learn Python on my own?Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your ownWhat is data science?We have more data than ever before But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns This is where data science comes in Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methodsWhat does a data scientist do?Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems This requires several steps First, they must identify a suitable problem Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into productionWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?Python is the most popular programming language for data science It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available It is also a good beginner language R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis You will want to know either Python or R and SQL SQL is a query language designed for relational databases Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases Those are the three most-used programming languages Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quicklyHow long does it take to become a data scientist?This answer, of course, varies The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn It will also depend on your starting place If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the fieldHow can I learn data science on my own?It is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available Start by determining what interests you about data science If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivatedDoes data science require coding?The jury is still out on this one Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill setWhat skills should a data scientist know?A data scientist requires many skills They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science Familiarity with machine learning is also important Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible mannerIs data science a good career?The demand for data scientists is growing We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers The jobs also generally pay well This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you First and foremost, you must think analytically Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for youVideo and Audio Production QualityAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you with the best learning experienceYou will be,Seeing clearlyHearing clearlyMoving through the course without distractionsYou'll also get:Lifetime Access to The CourseFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A sectionUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for DownloadWe offer full support, answering any questionsIf you are ready to learn the “Artificial intelligence with machine learning, deep learning” courseDive in now!

This is not a hands-on course.  We set out to explain all of the fundamental concepts you'll need in plain English. This course is broken into 5 key parts:Part 1: Models, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, & Artificial Intelligence DefinedThis part has a simple mission: to give you a solid understanding of what Machine Learning is.  Mastering the concepts and the terminology is your first step to leveraging them as a capability.  We walk through basic examples to solidify understanding.Part 2: Identifying Use CasesTired of hearing about the same 5 uses for machine learning over and over?  Not sure if ML even applies to you?  Take some expert advice on how you can discover ML opportunities in *your* organization.  Part 3: Qualifying Use CasesOnce you've identified a use for ML, you'll need to measure and qualify that opportunity.  How do you analyze and quantify the advantage of an ML-driven solution?  You do not need to be a data scientist to benefit from this discussion on measurement.  Essential knowledge for business leaders who are responsible for optimizing a business process.Part 4: Building an ML CompetencyKey considerations and tips on building / buying ML and AI solutions. Part 5: Strategic Take-awaysA view on how ML changes the landscape over the long term; and discussion of things you can do *now* to ensure your organization is ready to take advantage of machine learning in the future.Who this course is for:Business leaders, executives, product managers, process owners, service managers, or anyone who is responsible for how their organization operates.Suitable for people with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.Can be a helpful business-point-of-view for aspiring and experienced data scientists.Show moreShow less",
