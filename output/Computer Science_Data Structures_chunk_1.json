Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a senior developer. Graduates of this course are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta + other top tech companies.Want to land a job at a great tech company like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Amazon, or other companies but you are intimidated by the interview process and the coding questions? Do you find yourself feeling like you get \"stuck\" every time you get asked a coding question? This course is your answer. Using the strategies, lessons, and exercises in this course, you will learn how to land offers from all sorts of companies. Many developers who are \"self taught\", feel that one of the main disadvantages they face compared to college educated graduates in computer science is the fact that they don't have knowledge about algorithms, data structures and the notorious Big-O Notation. Get on the same level as someone with computer science degree by learning the fundamental building blocks of computer science which will give you a big boost during interviews. You will also get access to our private online chat community with thousands of developers online to help you get through the course.Here is what you will learn in this course:Technical:1. Big O notation2. Data structures: * Arrays* Hash Tables* Singly Linked Lists* Doubly Linked Lists* Queues* Stacks* Trees (BST, AVL Trees, Red Black Trees, Binary Heaps)* Tries* Graphs3. Algorithms: * Recursion* Sorting* Searching* Tree Traversal* Breadth First Search* Depth First Search* Dynamic ProgrammingNon Technical:- How to get more interviews- What to do during interviews- What do do after the interview- How to answer interview questions- How to handle offers- How to negotiate your salary- How to get a raiseUnlike most instructors, I am not a marketer or a salesperson. I am a senior developer and programmer who has worked and managed teams of engineers and have been in these interviews both as an interviewee as well as the interviewer.My job as an instructor will be successful if I am able to help you become better at interviewing and land more jobs. This one skill can really change the course of your career and I hope you sign up today to see what it can do for your career!Taught by:  Andrei is the instructor of the highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, JP Morgan, IBM, etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   See you inside the courses!Who this course is for:Any engineer, developer, programmer, who wants to improve their interviewing skillsAnyone interested in improving their whiteboard coding skillsAnyone who wants to become a better developerAny self taught programmer who missed out on a computer science degreeShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionUpdated in November 2018 with brand new section on Dynamic Programming!This course crams months of computer science and interview prep material into 20 hours of video. The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. Nothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal :)   We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. I start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.Here's why this course is worth your time:It's interactive -  I give you a chance to try every problem before I show you my solution.Every single problem has a complete solution walkthrough video as well as accompanying solution file.I cover helpful \"tips and tricks\" to solve common problems, but we also focus on building an approach to ANY problem.It's full of animations and beautiful diagrams!Are you looking to level-up your developer skills?

    "long_desc": "DescriptionSo you've worked with the basics of data structures and algorithms in Java (or another OO programming language) but feel like you need a deeper knowledge of how things work.\nMaybe you have taken other courses on this topic that focus more on teaching how to pass job interview tests (theory) instead of how to make good choices for the programs you develop (implementation).\nOr maybe you are ready to move from a junior programming position to a more senior one and need to get skilled in advanced concepts like data structures, and how to apply them to your own projects.\nWhatever the reason, if you are looking for a course that focus on the implementations to give you a complete understanding of how things work, then this is the course for you.\nThis course goes over the theory of how things work, but only to give you what you need to know to understand the implementation covered. \nComplete source code is included and available for you to download.\nThis is a hands-on course!  If you want to try understand things at a deep level, and work on implementations, rather than theory, then again, this is the course for you.\nTopics covered:-\nArraysLinked ListsTreesHashtablesStacksQueuesHeapsSort algorithmsSearch algorithms\nThe course also spends more time than most other courses of its kind looking at what’s available in the JDK. Students wanting to understand how things work \"under the hood\" will benefit enormously from this course.\nWhy learn about data structures and algorithms?\nThe reality is, the more you learn about data structures and algorithms, the better a programmer you become.\nWhy?\nBecause, data structures and algorithms are effectively patterns for solving problems.   You want to add as many of them as you can to your skill-set.  By doing so, you will find you solve more problems, and use the right tools for the job, in a more elegant way.  And you will learn a heap of them in this course.\nWhy enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.\nYour instructor, Sarah Ettritch has over 25 years’ software development experience and has been working with Java since JDK 1.1.  She has spent many years creating tools used by developers, which required a deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and is perfectly qualified to teach this course.\nMost courses focus on giving you the theory of how things work, so that you can take an interview.  Whilst the theory is important, the knowledge of how to implement these data structures and algorithms are of vital importance.This course goes over the theory of how things work, but only to give you what you need to know to understand the implementation covered.   The main focus of the course is to give you a real understanding of how things work under the hood, so that you can apply this to future programming projects.\nIf you want to actually understand how things work, and be able to take that understanding and apply it to your own programs, then this course is for you.\nAfter completing this course, you will have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms (both the theory, and the implementation).The sooner you sign up for this course, the sooner you will have the skills and knowledge you need to increase your job or consulting opportunities.    Java developers with key skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms are in high demand and get paid extremely well.\nIf you are ready for that new job promotion or consulting opportunity, it's time to get started.\nWhy not get started today?\n Click the Signup button to sign up for the courseWho this course is for:Developers who have some knowledge of Java (or another OO language) looking to understand data structures and algorithms at a deep levelShow moreShow less",

This course consists of lectures on data structures and algorithms which covers the computer science theory + implementation of data structures in python language. This course will also help students to face interviews at the top technology companies. This course is like having personal tutors to teach you about data structures and algorithms.There’s tons of concepts and content in this course. To begin the course:We have a discussion of why we need data structures.Then we move on to discuss Analysis of Algorithms ie Time and Space complexity, though the Asymptotic Notation ie Big O, Omega and Theta are taken up at the end of this course so that you do not get confused and concentrate on understanding the concepts of data structures. We have a programming environment setup to make sure you have all the software you need in order to get the hands-on experience in implementing Data structures and algorithms.Then we get to the essence of the course; algorithms and data structures. Each of the specific algorithms and data structures is divided into two sections. Theory lectures and implementation of those concepts in Python. We then move on to learn:RecursionStacks, Queues, DequesLinked ListTrees & Binary TreesBinary Search TreesPriority Queues and HeapsGraphs & Graph Traversal AlgorithmsSearching and Sorting algorithmsAgain, each of these sections includes theory lectures covering data structures & their Abstract Data Types and/or algorithms. Plus the implementation of these topics in Python.Who this course is for:Students who want to have better understanding of Data StructuresPython programmers curious about Data StructuresIT Professional experimenting implementation of Data Structures in PythonShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "Description    Building reliable and highly performant software requires knowledge that goes beyond a certain programming language or framework. It requires a solid understanding of how data is organized in memory, how it can be manipulated, sorted or searched into. There’s a reason why all the big tech companies such as Google, Amazon or Netflix focus their technical interviews on those topics. Whether you do mobile apps, websites, games, machine learning or any other work that involves coding, you need a good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.    Many self taught developers and aspiring engineers often feel they lack the knowledge when having to decide on the right data structure or the right approach for solving a problem. If you ever felt that way, this material is the right choice for you. This course packs months of Computer Science subject matter to get you on the same level of proficiency as someone with a Computer Science degree.What sets us apart ?    Every video begins with an in depth analysis of the topic at hand. At this stage we won’t write any code yet, but rather learn how to approach the problem, think of ways we could solve it and build a mental model of the solution.    We then go on to code the algorithm step by step. But we don’t stop there. We take one or more examples and walk through the code line by line. And we mean that literally. You will see how the code runs from top to bottom and how data flows and changes during execution. We find this method the absolute best way to really understand the inner workings of an algorithm.    We’ll also analyze the time performance and space utilization of every algorithm and method we write using the Big O Notation. We’ll talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and discuss their real world usage. Apart from all of that, you’ll also learn things like recursion, how computers work under the hood, problem solving techniques, common programming patterns and much more.What does this course cover ?How computers work under the hoodWhat a data structure isWhat an algorithm isProblem solving techniquesBig O Notation - how to analyze the time performance and space utilization of algorithms. This is done for every single function/algorithm we write.Gain a deeper understanding of how code worksRecursionData Structures:ArraysHash TablesSingly Linked ListsDoubly Linked ListsStacksQueuesBinary Search TreesTree TraversalHeapsGraphsSorting Algorithms:Insertion SortSelection SortBubble SortShell SortHeap SortMerge SortQuick SortRadix SortThanks for considering, and I hope this course will help you in your journey. Happy learning!Who this course is for:Self-taught engineers with a career in a different field that want to switch to the tech industryAnyone who is preparing for a technical interviewEngineers who want to build better tech fluency, land better roles, and push their career to new heightsComputer Science students who want to supplement their studies with alternative learning materialsShow moreShow less",

It can be fun. And I want you to know I am here for you every step of the way. Ask me any question. I usually get back to my students with 24 hrs. And together, we will get you the understanding behind how these things work. I also don’t have a formal computer science backgroundLook. I know what it’s like not to know how this stuff works. And, like you, I have had to learn this stuff from scratch.But I am here to tell you it can be done. I have no formal computer science background. I am not classically trained as a computer scientist. But by learning this material, I landed my dream job as an engineer at Spotify in San Francisco. And so can you.So what are you waiting for? Sign up and get started on your journey today.TestimonialsHere are some testimonials from students who have taken the course.Tiffany ScottBest $10 I've ever spent. The explanations are concise and are giving me confidence for my upcoming Microsoft and Facebook interviews. Planning on finishing the course in 4 days to give me ample time to practice problems.Saif Addin EllafiReally, this will sound like exaggeration. But this course is perfect, 5 stars falls short. The instructor puts the content in a an easy to follow order, videos are short to keep attention and leave you wanting to know more. Concise and important points are made very clear, with zero repetition. Native speaker offers no challenge for understanding, especially if you are not a native speaker. Answers questions very quickly. The course WONT teach you how to program, so forget about 100% coding from scratch or having pedagogical exercises. It relies on you to check out the code, re-write it, practice and research deeper the concepts. Examples are written in Java, but they are very agnostic to the language (aside of having to setup a java environment to run tests). Huge focus on acing interviews. A clear target of the course makes it great and an example. Time and pacing are perfect, no need to slow down or speed up. Overall 10 out of 5.Anna TeittinenI completed this course in my busy schedule within 3 weeks of learning I will have technical phone interviews with both Google and Facebook. I learned so much and understood everything without memorizing, unlike when I was in school. I recently learned I did well on both phone interviews. I will have a second technical phone interview with both companies again in mid Jan. I highly recommend this course! Thank you very much Jonathan!Rick AI took your course in the very beginning of my interview prep to refresh all my concepts. I think you've done a great job in this course. After a lot of practice using these concepts I got pretty good at it. I got multiple offers from big N including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. I would like to take this moment to thank you for creating the course and being available to answer our queries.Luciano SaAmazing course! Very well explained, great didactic which makes it very easy to follow and understand! I wish these stars were exponential. :)Kavitha BhaskerI am really thankful I found this course on Udemy. It has been 15 years since I learnt these concepts during my engineering college days and needed to brush up on them for interview prep. This course really nailed the contents and exercise that are asked in tech interviews these days. The tone of the instructor is very friendly and calm and make you think rather than put you in a spot. I was asked for a interview query on whether to use an array vs hashmap in a certain scenario and was able to nail the answer and also give the Time complexity with confidence . I landed the job and will be starting next week. Thank you so much!Eyal CarmiGreat. I like the that Jonathan filters what we actually need for an interview - instead of being flood with lot's of data, he notes you what worth remembering. His explanations are clear, and if you don't understand something, just ask him and he explains it to you.Flavio Marques Migowski CarvalhoOne of the best course I've had. It's very well explained, each step in the coding is shown and explained with drawings. I think some design and architecture problems would be very handy! Thank you for making this course for us!Abhishek SenguptaI think this is the best course on DSA I have ever seen. The reason i am saying this is because in previous courses I used to understand a write the code but soon after a day or so it was like 'what was that?' , but here every topic even after learning many other topics I can recall and code it. And I feel the reason for strong foundation is how Jonathon approaches and teaches the topic. In such a less duration he was able to solidify the concepts from scratch. BEST COURSE IN DSA! Jonathan Please do more courses on algorithms or Blind 75 topics. It will help engineers crack the interview easily after learning from you.MadhuI love the course overall. Very engaging. The Instructor, Jonathan is a great mentor and has this calm and assuring voice that puts the confidence in anyone who does not have programming experience before. He not only covered the technical aspects of almost all the important algorithms but also added a great ending with the interviewing tips which is really helpful. I would recommend this course to everyone who want to brush up on algorithms and just be ready enough to start with their interview.Juwan Turner-HowardI can program. I thought I \"knew\" about arrays, but this helping me to know the why which can allow me to make better tradeoffs when it's time to choose between linkedlist(probably O(n) get and set time) versus the O(1) array get and set time. If the rest of the course is consistent with the style and value of information in this first module... whew... I'm in for a good ride. So happy and excited about this course thus far though.Aung Khant NyraI would say Jonathan has done a great job of showing you how to prepare for interview problems by giving you a touch of basic data structures and a bird's eye view of the a typical interview. I am in the bay area and personally for me, this course is pretty basic and I am preparing for interviews myself, so this course was helpful for me although it didn't include advanced topics like dynamic programming and so on. Of course, there are countless interview practice problems online so I understand, it's impossible for him to cover everything. Anyways, I love the course . It is better to learn from a professional who is in the field instead of learning from a professor or a lecturer.Ramachandran RajagopalanGood course to wrap your head around DSA if you are a beginner. For others who have a got a week's time for the interview and need a refresher then grab this. Thanks, Jonathan. Good work.
