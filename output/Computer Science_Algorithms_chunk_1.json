I am a senior developer and programmer who has worked and managed teams of engineers and have been in these interviews both as an interviewee as well as the interviewer.My job as an instructor will be successful if I am able to help you become better at interviewing and land more jobs. This one skill can really change the course of your career and I hope you sign up today to see what it can do for your career!Taught by:  Andrei is the instructor of the highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, JP Morgan, IBM, etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   See you inside the courses!Who this course is for:Any engineer, developer, programmer, who wants to improve their interviewing skillsAnyone interested in improving their whiteboard coding skillsAnyone who wants to become a better developerAny self taught programmer who missed out on a computer science degreeShow moreShow less",

The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. Nothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal :)   We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. I start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.Here's why this course is worth your time:It's interactive -  I give you a chance to try every problem before I show you my solution.Every single problem has a complete solution walkthrough video as well as accompanying solution file.I cover helpful \"tips and tricks\" to solve common problems, but we also focus on building an approach to ANY problem.It's full of animations and beautiful diagrams!Are you looking to level-up your developer skills?

    "long_desc": "DescriptionAre you looking to enhance your programming skills and take your problem-solving abilities to the next level? Welcome to Mastering Algorithms: Solving Project Euler Challenges, a comprehensive course designed to help developers and enthusiasts alike sharpen their coding skills through engaging and challenging algorithmic problems.In my experience, there's nothing that competes with using the basics in a creative, clever way. Although I forgot most of my algebra and math theory as soon as I got out of school, I've found that this knowledge is incredibly valuable for becoming a better programmer and writing more efficient, scalable, and optimal solutions!Course Structure: Each video is dedicated to a single Project Euler problem. In the first half, we will be on the board, breaking down the problem (as they get very tricky to understand as we progress). In the second half, we will implement solutions and often find ways to optimize them. Currently, all problems videos use Python, for implementation because it is the most ubiquitous language for this kind of work. I am adding JavaScript/Node slowly. Even if you are a C, Java, or PHP developer, you will be able to follow the problem breakdown and have a good chance of understanding the Python code. If not, you’ll still be able to solve the problems on your own!What You’ll Get:In-Depth Lessons: Each video is carefully crafted to guide you through the intricacies of different problems, from basics to advanced topics. When I started, I couldn't find a consistent source for this material, so I've created one for you!Interactive Coding Exercises: Put your knowledge to the test with hands-on coding exercises and detailed walkthroughs.Community Support: Access to the Q&A section where you can post your solutions or get help when you're stumped. Collaborate with other like-minded learners who are eager to tackle these challenges.Expert Guidance: Benefit from my experience and insights as I help you navigate through each problem and develop effective solutions.By the end of this course, you’ll not only have solved numerous Project Euler problems but also gained a deeper understanding of algorithms and a robust skill set that will serve you well in your programming career. Enroll now and start your journey to becoming a master problem-solver!Who this course is for:Aspiring Developers: Ideal for those new to programming who want to build a solid foundation in algorithms and problem-solving.Experienced Programmers: Perfect for seasoned developers looking to refine their skills and tackle more challenging problems. These still challenge me to this day!Tech Enthusiasts: Great for anyone with a passion for coding and a desire to improve their technical prowess.Math Students: Nearly any student of mathematics will love the problem break downs.Show moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionIn this course, you will learn how to set up a cloud VPS server to ensure secure and uninterrupted operation for your trading robots.All configurations are applicable to both cloud servers and traditional Forex VPS. However, we use a cloud server as it offers better value for money.The course consists of two sections.SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO VPS SERVERS AND INITIAL SET UPIn the first section, I will introduce you to the world of VPS. We will discuss what they are and why they are essential for algorithmic traders. You will learn the criteria for selecting the best VPS provider and how cloud servers are a better solution than forex vps. Then, I will introduce you to the best VPS that I have found and that I currently use for my own trading.After this introduction, we will learn how to rent a VPS with the appropriate specifications based on your needs. Next, you will learn how to connect to the VPS from your personal computer (Windows or macOS) and how to transfer files securely.At the end of this section, you will learn how to install MetaTrader 5 and how to open multiple instances of this platform to trade multiple accounts.SECTION 2: ADVANCED VPS CONFIGURATIONS FOR TRADINGIn the second section, we will cover the different steps necessary to protect our robots from any power outages, connection drops, or unplanned shutdowns and reboots.In this section, we will adopt measures such as disabling Windows automatic updates, configuring automatic login after a reboot, and even the automatic launch of MT5 with all robots already deployed and fully operational.We will also create a log to monitor reboots and, finally, we will subject our VPS to an unplanned shutdown and watch it recover automatically.These and some additional topics are what you will find in this course, which you can check in the course description.If you’re passionate about algorithmic trading and want to succeed in it, you need a VPS.Do you want to be protected against connection or power outages?Do you want to free up your personal computer while the VPS handles your trading?Do you want secure and uninterrupted operations for your trading robots?If the answer is \"Yes,\" and you’re willing to put in the effort, this course is for you.This course is backed by Udemy’s 30-day money-back guarantee.If you’re not satisfied for any reason, you will receive a full refund!I’m confident you will find great value in all the knowledge and technical solutions shared in this course.Some of this information I have researched myself, and some has been shared by experts from the cloud provider I personally use.These are insights you won’t easily find elsewhere, and I’ve compiled and organized them to teach you a skill that will benefit you throughout your career.By the end of this course, you will have learned everything there is to know about VPS servers for trading and how to configure them to ensure secure and uninterrupted operation for your robots.If you like the program and are interested in trading financial markets with algorithms, don’t wait any longer!

I still can't believe it, it's incredibly surreal. And I can't thank you and this entire community enough for what you've given me. This year is notorious for how tumultuous it's been, but it's seriously has been a test from the first second of this year.. I've shed many, many tears these past 12 months and could write a book on the experience this year. but i just want to Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing me (and this community) the resources needed to realize my potential that I honestly never saw in myself.. and now that I know i can get this far, I know that this is only the beginning..\"Want to land a job at a great tech company like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Amazon, or other companies but you are intimidated by the interview process and the coding questions?

An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   -------Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy. He has been working as a software developer for numerous years in Toronto for some of the largest tech companies in the world. He has also been working as an instructor for more than a decade. He is focused on bringing everything he has learned to help you achieve a new career as a developer, but also give you all the fundamental skills required to flourish in this incredible industry.Yihua is a self taught developer, so he fully understands the challenges and mindset of coming into this industry from various other backgrounds. He has been on both sides of the table, as both an instructor and student numerous times so he can empathize with the difficulty of learning something new and challenging. Learning itself is a skill that needs to be practiced and improved upon, and he is dedicated to helping you improve and master that skill for yourself. Courses need to be practical, you need to be able to understand why you are learning the things that you are being taught. You need to understand the problem before you know the solution, and he prides himself on teaching you how to build professional, real world applications so you truly understand why you are doing things a specific way. He will teach you the mindset and skillset required to grow as a developer as fast as possible, so you can have the rich and fulfilling life that comes with this career.Yihua's courses will guide you to build beautifully written and richly featured applications, while truly understanding all the complex concepts you will encounter along the way.Who this course is for:Anyone that wants to work a Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Netflix or other top tech companiesAny engineer, developer, programmer, who wants to improve their interviewing skillsAnyone interested in improving their whiteboard coding skillsAnyone who wants to become a better developerAny self taught programmer who missed out on a computer science degreeShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "Description    Building reliable and highly performant software requires knowledge that goes beyond a certain programming language or framework. It requires a solid understanding of how data is organized in memory, how it can be manipulated, sorted or searched into. There’s a reason why all the big tech companies such as Google, Amazon or Netflix focus their technical interviews on those topics. Whether you do mobile apps, websites, games, machine learning or any other work that involves coding, you need a good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.    Many self taught developers and aspiring engineers often feel they lack the knowledge when having to decide on the right data structure or the right approach for solving a problem. If you ever felt that way, this material is the right choice for you. This course packs months of Computer Science subject matter to get you on the same level of proficiency as someone with a Computer Science degree.What sets us apart ?    Every video begins with an in depth analysis of the topic at hand. At this stage we won’t write any code yet, but rather learn how to approach the problem, think of ways we could solve it and build a mental model of the solution.    We then go on to code the algorithm step by step. But we don’t stop there. We take one or more examples and walk through the code line by line. And we mean that literally. You will see how the code runs from top to bottom and how data flows and changes during execution. We find this method the absolute best way to really understand the inner workings of an algorithm.    We’ll also analyze the time performance and space utilization of every algorithm and method we write using the Big O Notation. We’ll talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and discuss their real world usage. Apart from all of that, you’ll also learn things like recursion, how computers work under the hood, problem solving techniques, common programming patterns and much more.What does this course cover ?How computers work under the hoodWhat a data structure isWhat an algorithm isProblem solving techniquesBig O Notation - how to analyze the time performance and space utilization of algorithms. This is done for every single function/algorithm we write.Gain a deeper understanding of how code worksRecursionData Structures:ArraysHash TablesSingly Linked ListsDoubly Linked ListsStacksQueuesBinary Search TreesTree TraversalHeapsGraphsSorting Algorithms:Insertion SortSelection SortBubble SortShell SortHeap SortMerge SortQuick SortRadix SortThanks for considering, and I hope this course will help you in your journey.

Problems and solutions are explained very clearly - a lot better than the typical here is the solution to this problem. Ankit appears to really know this stuff. He spends the first half of each video working out examples on the white board before attempting the solution. And the best part is that Ankit responds quickly to all the questions asked. If you hit a road block doing LeetCode problems, get this course. Worth every penny.5 STARS - very good problems covered and also instructor wrote very clean and good code.Instructor is very responsive Thanks for the course 5 STARS - Great course to learn coding interview problems.5 STARS - The best course to prepare for coding interviews has lucid explaination of each and every problem.very good and simple to understand the codes as well as examples. The instructors are truly amazing. They make very simple to learn difficult topics. I highly recommended this course to crack coding interview.5 STARS -  He really knows how to explain concepts and repeats until it clicks in the head. Also I like the way he doesn't jump to the code until he explains all the concepts and algorithm to do with the problem.5 STARS -  like the clear-cut style. no nonsense!5 STARS - This course is really amazing. instructor is going beyond and beyond each and every thing was my beyond expectations. really mastery course it is.5 STARS - This is the best course on data structure compare to all data structure course .all the topic of data structure has been completed in this course .if anyone want to learn data structure then you can go for it. thank you sir for making this course on udemy5 STARS - This is the best computer science course I've taken. If you need to learn C++ and pass your technical interviews, this is the course to take.

    "long_desc": "DescriptionAngela Belfort, CEO of Firma Logistics strode into the meeting room quietly enraged. The way CEOs are enraged, composed and at the same time fuming. She is followed by her entourage. All the important people that make all the decisions. You’ve been at the company for just over a year and you’re not quite sure how you ended up in this room.Her assistant had already set the room projector showing the live feed of the company’s fleet, over 4000 lorries scattered all over the country. Each vehicle was shown as a dot, colored red as stationary, green as moving. Almost all of them were red.“What the hell is going on? I have lorry drivers complaining to unions because we aren’t able to give them a delivery schedule. I have furious suppliers on the lines asking for updates on their packages. We’ve got competitors circling over our clients like vultures. Can someone explain to me what is happening?”, Angela started.Everyone was expecting an answer from the CTO, Brian Holms. Technically, on the huge org chart, he is your manager somewhere along the path from your position to the top, but it sure is a long way. He replies with “Er… em… We seem to be having some IT issues. I brought Alex here with me as she seems to have found a bug in the system”.The focus is now completely on you. Hey, this might be the day you get fired after all… “It’s not really a bug. A section of the current scheduling algorithm has a quadratic runtime complexity with respect to the number of routes”.The room looks at you as if you said the moon was made out of cheese. The big wigs turn their heads back to Brian for an explanation, but he seems as lost as they are. Instead he nervously nods, encouraging you to go on.“Ok. Remember Paul Zimmer? Our ex-tech lead guy? Well it turns out that some of his old code does not scale well. It was fine while we had a few hundred lorries, but now that the company has grown so much the scheduling program is not able to keep up with the load. Especially on busy days like today. We have not really invested in keeping the code with the latest technologies and now nobody knows how it really works.” This is literally the most dumbed down version you can think of.Angela jumps in “Where is this Paul?”“He retired about a year ago. Rumor has it he opened an American diner in Hong Kong.”, replies Brian.Angela’s composure is all gone now. “Can we fix the damn thing?”, she shouts.“Well it’s very old code, nobody really understands how it works and we have been trying to reach Paul but if he’s in a different country… ”, puts in Brian but is interrupted by you.“I already have a working linear solution. By linear I mean it will scale fine with our needs. I just need to run some further testing and then we can probably release it.”Brian is visibly shocked. Everyone else is kind of confused, not completely sure what is going on. Angela is the only one with a grin.Understanding the basics of Big O notation and being able to \"read\" how much an algorithm can scale is a must for all serious developers. This extra skill gives you the edge to take your career forward, to distinguish yourself from the rest of the crowd and get ahead. It helps you pass difficult coding interviews to get hired from some of the best tech companies.The code in this course is in Python however if you have experience from any other major programming language (such as Java, C#, JavaScript, Ruby etc...) you'll be ok with the code in the course as it's designed to be easy to grasp.All code in this course can be found on github, username/project: cutajarj/BigONotationInPlainEnglishSo don't be a Brian, sign up to the course and learn something new today!Who this course is for:Self taught developers that want to up their game and learn about how to measure and improve their code.College students that are struggling with the Big O Notation, Algorithms and Complexity theory topic.Experienced developers that require a refresher, perhaps for an upcoming interview.CTOs named Brian HolmesShow moreShow less",
