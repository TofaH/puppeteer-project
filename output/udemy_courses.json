    "long_desc": "DescriptionA warm welcome to the Internet of things (IoT) course by Uplatz.The Internet of things (IoT) is a term for the growing number of electronics that aren't traditional computing devices, but are connected to the internet to send data, receive instructions or both.There's an incredibly broad range of things that fall under that umbrella: Internet-connected smart versions of traditional appliances like refrigerators and light bulbs, gadgets that could only exist in an internet-enabled world like Alexa-style digital assistants; internet-enabled sensors that are transforming factories, healthcare, transportation, distribution centers and farms.The Internet of Things is transforming our physical world into a complex and dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale. The IoT brings the power of the internet, data processing and analytics to the real world of physical objects. For consumers, this means interacting with the global information network without the intermediary of a keyboard and screen; many of their everyday objects and appliances can take instructions from that network with minimal human intervention.Simply put, IoT is about connecting machines or, as we refer to them, ‘things’ that were previously ‘dumb objects’. You can think everything from your toaster to a security camera, to the internet in order to transmit the data they collect, monitor them and enable them to ‘talk to each other’.Advances in technology are making possible a more widespread adoption of IoT, from pill-shaped micro-cameras that can pinpoint thousands of images within the body, to smart sensors that can assess crop conditions on a farm, to the smart home devices that are becoming increasingly popular.Uplatz provides this comprehensive course on IoT basics to help you get started with the IoT world. This IoT course will help you:Describe the evolution of the Internet of ThingsIdentify the range of options for the way things can communicateSelect the standards most appropriate for building successful communicationsBuild addressing architectures that can scale to the sizes requiredAnalyze and record the interactionsVisualize the results of interactionsDeliver the security that modern services demandBuild new service networks that can support the future Internet of ThingsIn this Internet of Things (IoT) course, students will learn general strategies for planning, designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining an IoT system. Besides other things, you will learn what are the building blocks of IoT and what are the underlying technologies that drive the IoT revolution. There is also a case study on building a smart city by assembling and configuring IoT devices to work in a sensor network.Course ObjectivesUnderstand the basic concepts of IoTPlan an IoT implementationConstruct and program an IoT deviceCommunicate with an IoT device using wired and wireless connectionsProcess sensor input and control an actuator on an IoT deviceManage security, privacy, and safety risks on IoT projectsLearn how to apply Machine Learning in IoTManage an IoT prototyping and development project throughout the development lifecycleInternet of Things (IoT) Fundamentals - Course Syllabus1.

This course will demystify the workings of information technology, making all of these things clear to students. If you are a beginner looking to obtain a tech job or internship or you are a college student looking to get a competitive edge, this course will give you a foundation of basic IT and Computer Engineering knowledge.\n        First, we will look at the basic architecture of a computer, in other words, the parts that make up a computer and what they do. Next, we will look into the concept of networking. Topics explored here will include the 7 layer network model, servers and clients, network topology, and the basic parts of a URL. You will get hands-on experience using proxy software to see requests and responses in real time. Finally, we will look at the basics of the terminal, or command line. We will explore topics like system file structure and hierarchy, basic terminal commands, and will do a hands-on demo of how to use the command line to perform basic operations such as navigating a file directory and performing operations on files.\n\n        By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the basic internal workings of a computer and the internet. Next time you turn on your computer or type a URL into the search bar, you will understand what is happening and why things work the way they do. Remember, even though technology may seem to work like “magic” it is really just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s communicating with the hardware to perform operations. \nWho this course is for:Anyone who wants to land a job or internship related to technologyAnyone looking to boost their resume with technical skills and know-howHigh school or college students starting classes in IT or Computer EngineeringShow moreShow less",

It involves the design, development, implementation, support, and management of computer-based information systems, including hardware, software, and networks. The field of information technology is broad and encompasses many different subfields, including: Computer programming and software development Database management and administration Network and system administration Cybersecurity and information assurance Web development and design Technical support and helpdesk management Project management and business analysis Artificial intelligence and machine learning Cloud computing and virtualization Digital media and entertainment technology Professionals in the field of IT work in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, government, education, entertainment, and many others. They are responsible for designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining computer-based systems that help organizations manage and use information more effectively. The IT industry is constantly evolving and growing, with new technologies and innovations emerging regularly. As a result, professionals in this field are required to continually learn and adapt to keep up with the latest trends and developments.Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of users.Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC. However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\"Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. As this field continues to evolve across the world, the overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related courses in K-12 education. However, concerns have been raised about this fact that most schools are lacking advanced-placement courses in this field.Who this course is for:Who wants to seat for Information Technology ExamShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionInformation technology (IT), as defined by the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA), is “the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware.” IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to , store, protect, process, transmit, and securely retrieve information. Today, the term information has ballooned to encompass many aspects of computing and technology, and the term has become very recognizable. IT professionals perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases. A few of the duties that IT professionals perform may include data management, networking, engineering computer hardware, database and software design, as well as the management and administration of entire systems. When computer and communications technologies are combined, the result is information technology, or “infotech”. Information technology is a general term that describes any technology that helps to produce, manipulate, store, communicate, and/or disseminate information. Presumably, when speaking of Information Technology (IT) as a whole, it is noted that the use of computers and information are associated. In recent days ABET and the ACM have collaborated to form accreditation and curriculum standards for degrees in Information Technology as a distinct field of study separate from both Computer Science and Information Systems. Information technology (IT) is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information by a microelectronics based combination of computing and telecommunications. The term in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review, in which authors Leavitt and Whisler commented that “the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).Who this course is for:ManagersBBA StudentsMBA StudentsProfessionalShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionIn today’s competitive marketplace, companies are under constant pressure to perform in a business environment of reduced capital, slowing growth rates, and increased shareholder demands. Now more than ever, it’s important that your organisation learns to maximise the power of its working capital by cutting costs and reducing the expenses associated with its Supply Chain Operations.Every organisation, whether it manufactures goods or provides services, needs a reliable flow of materials. Global logistics operations play an essential role in the commercial supply chain function, and are responsible for all aspects of material movement. In fact, wise business owners and managers are quickly realising that, rather than being an isolated operation, their supply chain occupies a unique position in linking external suppliers with customers. If you want your organisation to benefit from a more competitive position, it’s crucial that you take steps to develop and implement an effective logistics strategy as part of your supply chain integration.   Logistics and Supply Chain Management is a particularly fast-moving field whose ultimate goal is to delight and satisfy the customer. The methods and management strategies your business adopts for everything from procurement of goods to control of inventory will have a profound impact on costs, customer service, and your company’s overall profitability.    No business works in isolation, and recent developments in how companies operate in terms of integrating fresh technologies, exploiting global markets, and serving and communicating with customers are making new demands on planning and controlling the flow of materials. This course has been designed to give business owners and managers a current view of supply chain management, and an introduction to the best methods for responding to modern demands through improvements in areas like capacity, warehouse, and transportation strategies.     This course will teach you everything you need to know to successfully manage the end-to-end, forward and backward flow of materials and information across your supply chain. Together, we’ll examine the concepts, tactics, and applications of various logistics tools and technologies in order to promote a big-picture understanding that extends well beyond internal operations.   By the end of this course, you’ll have a valuable and practical skill set that will allow you to create, implement, and oversee the activities of a global supply chain involving suppliers, distributors, and customers world-wide. You’ll know how to consistently adhere to best practices, and you’ll understand the common terminology that’s used in corporate communications. By showing you how to modernise your approach to supply chain management, this course will make it possible to improve your position in the marketplace through the efficient flow of goods and materials from the supplier, to your business, to the customer – and back again.Who this course is for:This course is designed for beginners and intermediate students/professionals in logistics, supply chain and operations management who want to improve and broaden their scope of knowledge on the subject.This course is designed for more seasoned professionals looking for a quick refresher and test their knowledge and application of logistics and supply chain management.Show moreShow less",

An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   See you inside the courses!Who this course is for:Any engineer, developer, programmer, who wants to improve their interviewing skillsAnyone interested in improving their whiteboard coding skillsAnyone who wants to become a better developerAny self taught programmer who missed out on a computer science degreeShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionUpdated in November 2018 with brand new section on Dynamic Programming!This course crams months of computer science and interview prep material into 20 hours of video. The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. Nothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal :)   We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. I start by teaching you how to analyze your code’s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.Here's why this course is worth your time:It's interactive -  I give you a chance to try every problem before I show you my solution.Every single problem has a complete solution walkthrough video as well as accompanying solution file.I cover helpful \"tips and tricks\" to solve common problems, but we also focus on building an approach to ANY problem.It's full of animations and beautiful diagrams!Are you looking to level-up your developer skills?

    "long_desc": "DescriptionAre you looking to enhance your programming skills and take your problem-solving abilities to the next level? Welcome to Mastering Algorithms: Solving Project Euler Challenges, a comprehensive course designed to help developers and enthusiasts alike sharpen their coding skills through engaging and challenging algorithmic problems.In my experience, there's nothing that competes with using the basics in a creative, clever way. Although I forgot most of my algebra and math theory as soon as I got out of school, I've found that this knowledge is incredibly valuable for becoming a better programmer and writing more efficient, scalable, and optimal solutions!Course Structure: Each video is dedicated to a single Project Euler problem. In the first half, we will be on the board, breaking down the problem (as they get very tricky to understand as we progress). In the second half, we will implement solutions and often find ways to optimize them. Currently, all problems videos use Python, for implementation because it is the most ubiquitous language for this kind of work. I am adding JavaScript/Node slowly. Even if you are a C, Java, or PHP developer, you will be able to follow the problem breakdown and have a good chance of understanding the Python code. If not, you’ll still be able to solve the problems on your own!What You’ll Get:In-Depth Lessons: Each video is carefully crafted to guide you through the intricacies of different problems, from basics to advanced topics. When I started, I couldn't find a consistent source for this material, so I've created one for you!Interactive Coding Exercises: Put your knowledge to the test with hands-on coding exercises and detailed walkthroughs.Community Support: Access to the Q&A section where you can post your solutions or get help when you're stumped. Collaborate with other like-minded learners who are eager to tackle these challenges.Expert Guidance: Benefit from my experience and insights as I help you navigate through each problem and develop effective solutions.By the end of this course, you’ll not only have solved numerous Project Euler problems but also gained a deeper understanding of algorithms and a robust skill set that will serve you well in your programming career. Enroll now and start your journey to becoming a master problem-solver!Who this course is for:Aspiring Developers: Ideal for those new to programming who want to build a solid foundation in algorithms and problem-solving.Experienced Programmers: Perfect for seasoned developers looking to refine their skills and tackle more challenging problems. These still challenge me to this day!Tech Enthusiasts: Great for anyone with a passion for coding and a desire to improve their technical prowess.Math Students: Nearly any student of mathematics will love the problem break downs.Show moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionIn this course, you will learn how to set up a cloud VPS server to ensure secure and uninterrupted operation for your trading robots.All configurations are applicable to both cloud servers and traditional Forex VPS. However, we use a cloud server as it offers better value for money.The course consists of two sections.SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO VPS SERVERS AND INITIAL SET UPIn the first section, I will introduce you to the world of VPS. We will discuss what they are and why they are essential for algorithmic traders. You will learn the criteria for selecting the best VPS provider and how cloud servers are a better solution than forex vps. Then, I will introduce you to the best VPS that I have found and that I currently use for my own trading.After this introduction, we will learn how to rent a VPS with the appropriate specifications based on your needs. Next, you will learn how to connect to the VPS from your personal computer (Windows or macOS) and how to transfer files securely.At the end of this section, you will learn how to install MetaTrader 5 and how to open multiple instances of this platform to trade multiple accounts.SECTION 2: ADVANCED VPS CONFIGURATIONS FOR TRADINGIn the second section, we will cover the different steps necessary to protect our robots from any power outages, connection drops, or unplanned shutdowns and reboots.In this section, we will adopt measures such as disabling Windows automatic updates, configuring automatic login after a reboot, and even the automatic launch of MT5 with all robots already deployed and fully operational.We will also create a log to monitor reboots and, finally, we will subject our VPS to an unplanned shutdown and watch it recover automatically.These and some additional topics are what you will find in this course, which you can check in the course description.If you’re passionate about algorithmic trading and want to succeed in it, you need a VPS.Do you want to be protected against connection or power outages?Do you want to free up your personal computer while the VPS handles your trading?Do you want secure and uninterrupted operations for your trading robots?If the answer is \"Yes,\" and you’re willing to put in the effort, this course is for you.This course is backed by Udemy’s 30-day money-back guarantee.If you’re not satisfied for any reason, you will receive a full refund!I’m confident you will find great value in all the knowledge and technical solutions shared in this course.Some of this information I have researched myself, and some has been shared by experts from the cloud provider I personally use.These are insights you won’t easily find elsewhere, and I’ve compiled and organized them to teach you a skill that will benefit you throughout your career.By the end of this course, you will have learned everything there is to know about VPS servers for trading and how to configure them to ensure secure and uninterrupted operation for your robots.If you like the program and are interested in trading financial markets with algorithms, don’t wait any longer!

This year is notorious for how tumultuous it's been, but it's seriously has been a test from the first second of this year.. I've shed many, many tears these past 12 months and could write a book on the experience this year. but i just want to Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing me (and this community) the resources needed to realize my potential that I honestly never saw in myself.. and now that I know i can get this far, I know that this is only the beginning..\"Want to land a job at a great tech company like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Amazon, or other companies but you are intimidated by the interview process and the coding questions?

An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   -------Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy. He has been working as a software developer for numerous years in Toronto for some of the largest tech companies in the world. He has also been working as an instructor for more than a decade. He is focused on bringing everything he has learned to help you achieve a new career as a developer, but also give you all the fundamental skills required to flourish in this incredible industry.Yihua is a self taught developer, so he fully understands the challenges and mindset of coming into this industry from various other backgrounds. He has been on both sides of the table, as both an instructor and student numerous times so he can empathize with the difficulty of learning something new and challenging. Learning itself is a skill that needs to be practiced and improved upon, and he is dedicated to helping you improve and master that skill for yourself. Courses need to be practical, you need to be able to understand why you are learning the things that you are being taught. You need to understand the problem before you know the solution, and he prides himself on teaching you how to build professional, real world applications so you truly understand why you are doing things a specific way. He will teach you the mindset and skillset required to grow as a developer as fast as possible, so you can have the rich and fulfilling life that comes with this career.Yihua's courses will guide you to build beautifully written and richly featured applications, while truly understanding all the complex concepts you will encounter along the way.Who this course is for:Anyone that wants to work a Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Netflix or other top tech companiesAny engineer, developer, programmer, who wants to improve their interviewing skillsAnyone interested in improving their whiteboard coding skillsAnyone who wants to become a better developerAny self taught programmer who missed out on a computer science degreeShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "Description    Building reliable and highly performant software requires knowledge that goes beyond a certain programming language or framework. It requires a solid understanding of how data is organized in memory, how it can be manipulated, sorted or searched into. There’s a reason why all the big tech companies such as Google, Amazon or Netflix focus their technical interviews on those topics. Whether you do mobile apps, websites, games, machine learning or any other work that involves coding, you need a good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.    Many self taught developers and aspiring engineers often feel they lack the knowledge when having to decide on the right data structure or the right approach for solving a problem. If you ever felt that way, this material is the right choice for you. This course packs months of Computer Science subject matter to get you on the same level of proficiency as someone with a Computer Science degree.What sets us apart ?    Every video begins with an in depth analysis of the topic at hand. At this stage we won’t write any code yet, but rather learn how to approach the problem, think of ways we could solve it and build a mental model of the solution.    We then go on to code the algorithm step by step. But we don’t stop there. We take one or more examples and walk through the code line by line. And we mean that literally. You will see how the code runs from top to bottom and how data flows and changes during execution. We find this method the absolute best way to really understand the inner workings of an algorithm.    We’ll also analyze the time performance and space utilization of every algorithm and method we write using the Big O Notation. We’ll talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and discuss their real world usage. Apart from all of that, you’ll also learn things like recursion, how computers work under the hood, problem solving techniques, common programming patterns and much more.What does this course cover ?How computers work under the hoodWhat a data structure isWhat an algorithm isProblem solving techniquesBig O Notation - how to analyze the time performance and space utilization of algorithms. This is done for every single function/algorithm we write.Gain a deeper understanding of how code worksRecursionData Structures:ArraysHash TablesSingly Linked ListsDoubly Linked ListsStacksQueuesBinary Search TreesTree TraversalHeapsGraphsSorting Algorithms:Insertion SortSelection SortBubble SortShell SortHeap SortMerge SortQuick SortRadix SortThanks for considering, and I hope this course will help you in your journey.

Problems and solutions are explained very clearly - a lot better than the typical here is the solution to this problem. Ankit appears to really know this stuff. He spends the first half of each video working out examples on the white board before attempting the solution. And the best part is that Ankit responds quickly to all the questions asked. If you hit a road block doing LeetCode problems, get this course. Worth every penny.5 STARS - very good problems covered and also instructor wrote very clean and good code.Instructor is very responsive Thanks for the course 5 STARS - Great course to learn coding interview problems.5 STARS - The best course to prepare for coding interviews has lucid explaination of each and every problem.very good and simple to understand the codes as well as examples. The instructors are truly amazing. They make very simple to learn difficult topics. I highly recommended this course to crack coding interview.5 STARS -  He really knows how to explain concepts and repeats until it clicks in the head. Also I like the way he doesn't jump to the code until he explains all the concepts and algorithm to do with the problem.5 STARS -  like the clear-cut style. no nonsense!5 STARS - This course is really amazing. instructor is going beyond and beyond each and every thing was my beyond expectations. really mastery course it is.5 STARS - This is the best course on data structure compare to all data structure course .all the topic of data structure has been completed in this course .if anyone want to learn data structure then you can go for it. thank you sir for making this course on udemy5 STARS - This is the best computer science course I've taken. If you need to learn C++ and pass your technical interviews, this is the course to take. The explanations in the videos are extremely thorough, and I have reached out to the instructor several times on various questions, and he's always quick to respond and very helpful. In my experience, every MOOC that said its instructors would actively help you with problems lied, EXCEPT FOR THIS COURSE. TAKE THIS COURSE!5 STARS - I liked this course very much! It clears out your basics quite well and is does totally what Harsh and Ankit claim they'll do. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, especially if you had a phobia for coding like I did. I now love coding! All thanks to them.5 STARS - This is the BEST COURSE on C++ Data Structures & Algorithms. The Instructors are the BEST. They Draw Everything out and Then EXPLAIN THE CONCEPTS VERY WELL & then CODE it. Also I Love Doing the LEETCODE ProblemSets. Absolutely Fantastic. Above my Expectations.

    "long_desc": "DescriptionAngela Belfort, CEO of Firma Logistics strode into the meeting room quietly enraged. The way CEOs are enraged, composed and at the same time fuming. She is followed by her entourage. All the important people that make all the decisions. You’ve been at the company for just over a year and you’re not quite sure how you ended up in this room.Her assistant had already set the room projector showing the live feed of the company’s fleet, over 4000 lorries scattered all over the country. Each vehicle was shown as a dot, colored red as stationary, green as moving. Almost all of them were red.“What the hell is going on? I have lorry drivers complaining to unions because we aren’t able to give them a delivery schedule. I have furious suppliers on the lines asking for updates on their packages. We’ve got competitors circling over our clients like vultures. Can someone explain to me what is happening?”, Angela started.Everyone was expecting an answer from the CTO, Brian Holms. Technically, on the huge org chart, he is your manager somewhere along the path from your position to the top, but it sure is a long way. He replies with “Er… em… We seem to be having some IT issues. I brought Alex here with me as she seems to have found a bug in the system”.The focus is now completely on you. Hey, this might be the day you get fired after all… “It’s not really a bug. A section of the current scheduling algorithm has a quadratic runtime complexity with respect to the number of routes”.The room looks at you as if you said the moon was made out of cheese. The big wigs turn their heads back to Brian for an explanation, but he seems as lost as they are. Instead he nervously nods, encouraging you to go on.“Ok. Remember Paul Zimmer? Our ex-tech lead guy? Well it turns out that some of his old code does not scale well. It was fine while we had a few hundred lorries, but now that the company has grown so much the scheduling program is not able to keep up with the load. Especially on busy days like today. We have not really invested in keeping the code with the latest technologies and now nobody knows how it really works.” This is literally the most dumbed down version you can think of.Angela jumps in “Where is this Paul?”“He retired about a year ago. Rumor has it he opened an American diner in Hong Kong.”, replies Brian.Angela’s composure is all gone now. “Can we fix the damn thing?”, she shouts.“Well it’s very old code, nobody really understands how it works and we have been trying to reach Paul but if he’s in a different country… ”, puts in Brian but is interrupted by you.“I already have a working linear solution. By linear I mean it will scale fine with our needs. I just need to run some further testing and then we can probably release it.”Brian is visibly shocked. Everyone else is kind of confused, not completely sure what is going on. Angela is the only one with a grin.Understanding the basics of Big O notation and being able to \"read\" how much an algorithm can scale is a must for all serious developers. This extra skill gives you the edge to take your career forward, to distinguish yourself from the rest of the crowd and get ahead. It helps you pass difficult coding interviews to get hired from some of the best tech companies.The code in this course is in Python however if you have experience from any other major programming language (such as Java, C#, JavaScript, Ruby etc...) you'll be ok with the code in the course as it's designed to be easy to grasp.All code in this course can be found on github, username/project: cutajarj/BigONotationInPlainEnglishSo don't be a Brian, sign up to the course and learn something new today!Who this course is for:Self taught developers that want to up their game and learn about how to measure and improve their code.College students that are struggling with the Big O Notation, Algorithms and Complexity theory topic.Experienced developers that require a refresher, perhaps for an upcoming interview.CTOs named Brian HolmesShow moreShow less",

Simply put, we build here an AI Doctor Chatbot.But that's not all... Once you complete the course, you will get 3 extra AIs: DDPG, Full World Model, and Evolution Strategies & Genetic Algorithms. We build these AIs with ChatGPT for a Self-Driving Car and a Humanoid application. For each of these extra AIs you will get a long video lecture explaining the implementation, a mini PDF, and the Python code.Besides, you will get a free 3-hour extra course on Generative AI and LLMs with Cloud Computing as a Prize for completing the course.And last but not least, here is what you will get with this course:1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.2. Hassle-Free Coding and Code templates – We will build all our AIs in Google Colab, which means that we will have absolutely NO hassle installing libraries or packages because everything is already pre-installed in Google Colab notebooks. Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates (in .py and .ipynb) for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in AI for much better results down the line.4. Real-world solutions – You’ll achieve your goal in not only one AI model but in 5. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.5. In-course support – We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.So, are you ready to embrace the fascinating world of AI?Come join us, never stop learning, and enjoy AI!Who this course is for:Anyone interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or Deep LearningShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionBecome a complete A.I., Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer! Join a live online community of 900,000+ engineers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked for large companies in places like Silicon Valley and Toronto. Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies. You will go from zero to mastery!Learn Data Science and Machine Learning from scratch, get hired, and have fun along the way with the most modern, up-to-date Data Science course on Udemy (we use the latest version of Python, Tensorflow 2.0 and other libraries). This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Machine Learning tutorials anymore. We are pretty confident that this is the most comprehensive and modern course you will find on the subject anywhere (bold statement, we know).This comprehensive and project based course will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Data Scientist and along the way, we will build many real world projects to add to your portfolio. You will get access to all the code, workbooks and templates (Jupyter Notebooks) on Github, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away! We believe this course solves the biggest challenge to entering the Data Science and Machine Learning field: having all the necessary resources in one place and learning the latest trends and on the job skills that employers want. The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Machine Learning and Data Science engineer. The course covers 2 tracks. If you already know programming, you can dive right in and skip the section where we teach you Python from scratch. If you are completely new, we take you from the very beginning and actually teach you Python and how to use it in the real world for our projects. Don't worry, once we go through the basics like Machine Learning 101 and Python, we then get going into advanced topics like Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world (We show you fully fledged Data Science and Machine Learning projects and give you programming Resources and Cheatsheets)!The topics covered in this course are:- Data Exploration and Visualizations- Neural Networks and Deep Learning- Model Evaluation and Analysis- Python 3- Tensorflow 2.0- Numpy- Scikit-Learn- Data Science and Machine Learning Projects and Workflows- Data Visualization in Python with MatPlotLib and Seaborn- Transfer Learning- Image recognition and classification- Train/Test and cross validation- Supervised Learning: Classification, Regression and Time Series- Decision Trees and Random Forests- Ensemble Learning- Hyperparameter Tuning- Using Pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks- Use Pandas to handle CSV Files- Deep Learning / Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras- Using Kaggle and entering Machine Learning competitions- How to present your findings and impress your boss- How to clean and prepare your data for analysis- K Nearest Neighbours- Support Vector Machines- Regression analysis (Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression)- How Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink are used- Setting up your environment with Conda, MiniConda, and Jupyter Notebooks- Using GPUs with Google ColabBy the end of this course, you will be a complete Data Scientist that can get hired at large companies. We are going to use everything we learn in the course to build professional real world projects like Heart Disease Detection, Bulldozer Price Predictor, Dog Breed Image Classifier, and many more. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Data Science and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is, you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. Or they show you a lot of code and complex math on the screen, but they don't really explain things well enough for you to go off on your own and solve real life machine learning problems. Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Data Science skills, or are coming from a different industry, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no Data Science experience, to someone that can go off, forget about Daniel and Andrei, and build their own Data Science and Machine learning workflows. Machine Learning has applications in Business Marketing and Finance, Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Retail, Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture, Internet of Things, Gaming and Entertainment, Patient Diagnosis, Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing, Government, Academia/Research, Recommendation Systems and so much more. The skills learned in this course are going to give you a lot of options for your career. You hear statements like Artificial Neural Network, or Artificial Intelligence (AI), and by the end of this course, you will finally understand what these mean!Click “Enroll Now” and join others in our community to get a leg up in the industry, and learn Data Scientist and Machine Learning. We guarantee this is better than any bootcamp or online course out there on the topic. See you inside the course!Taught By:Daniel Bourke:A self-taught Machine Learning Engineer who lives on the internet with an uncurable desire to take long walks and fill up blank pages.My experience in machine learning comes from working at one of Australia's fastest-growing artificial intelligence agencies, Max Kelsen.I've worked on machine learning and data problems across a wide range of industries including healthcare, eCommerce, finance, retail and more.Two of my favourite projects include building a machine learning model to extract information from doctors notes for one of Australia's leading medical research facilities, as well as building a natural language model to assess insurance claims for one of Australia's largest insurance groups.Due to the performance of the natural language model (a model which reads insurance claims and decides which party is at fault), the insurance company were able to reduce their daily assessment load by up to 2,500 claims.My long-term goal is to combine my knowledge of machine learning and my background in nutrition to work towards answering the question \"what should I eat?\".Aside from building machine learning models on my own, I love writing about and making videos on the process. My articles and videos on machine learning on Medium, personal blog and YouTube have collectively received over 5-million views.I love nothing more than a complicated topic explained in an entertaining and educative matter. I know what it's like to try and learn a new topic, online and on your own. So I pour my soul into making sure my creations are accessible as possible.My modus operandi (a fancy term for my way of doing things) is learning to create and creating to learn. If you know the Japanese word for this concept, please let me know.Questions are always welcome.Andrei Neagoie:Andrei is the instructor of the highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.   Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.   See you inside the course!Who this course is for:Anyone with zero experience (or beginner/junior) who wants to learn Machine Learning,  Data Science and PythonYou are a programmer that wants to extend their skills into Data Science and Machine Learning to make yourself more valuableAnyone who wants to learn these topics from industry experts that don’t only teach, but have actually worked in the fieldYou’re looking for one single course to teach you about Machine learning and Data Science and get you caught up to speed with the industryYou want to learn the fundamentals and be able to truly understand the topics instead of just watching somebody code on your screen for hours without really “getting it”You want to learn to use Deep learning and Neural Networks with your projectsYou want to add value to your own business or  company you work for, by using powerful Machine Learning tools.Show moreShow less",

In this course, you will learn the foundations of these groundbreaking applications.Welcome to Tensorflow 2.0!What an exciting time. It's been nearly 4 years since Tensorflow was released, and the library has evolved to its official second version.Tensorflow is Google's library for deep learning and artificial intelligence.Deep Learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as:Generating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (GANs)Beating world champions in the strategy game Go, and complex video games like CS:GO and Dota 2 (Deep Reinforcement Learning)Self-driving cars (Computer Vision)Speech recognition (e.g. Siri) and machine translation (Natural Language Processing)Even creating videos of people doing and saying things they never did (DeepFakes - a potentially nefarious application of deep learning)Tensorflow is the world's most popular library for deep learning, and it's built by Google, whose parent Alphabet recently became the most cash-rich company in the world (just a few days before I wrote this). It is the library of choice for many companies doing AI and machine learning.In other words, if you want to do deep learning, you gotta know Tensorflow.This course is for beginner-level students all the way up to expert-level students. How can this be?If you've just taken my free Numpy prerequisite, then you know everything you need to jump right in. We will start with some very basic machine learning models and advance to state of the art concepts.Along the way, you will learn about all of the major deep learning architectures, such as Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (image processing), and Recurrent Neural Networks (sequence data).Current projects include:Natural Language Processing (NLP)Recommender SystemsTransfer Learning for Computer VisionGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Deep Reinforcement Learning Stock Trading BotEven if you've taken all of my previous courses already, you will still learn about how to convert your previous code so that it uses Tensorflow 2.0, and there are all-new and never-before-seen projects in this course such as time series forecasting and how to do stock predictions.This course is designed for students who want to learn fast, but there are also \"in-depth\" sections in case you want to dig a little deeper into the theory (like what is a loss function, and what are the different types of gradient descent approaches).Advanced Tensorflow topics include:Deploying a model with Tensorflow Serving (Tensorflow in the cloud)Deploying a model with Tensorflow Lite (mobile and embedded applications)Distributed Tensorflow training with Distribution StrategiesWriting your own custom Tensorflow modelConverting Tensorflow 1.x code to Tensorflow 2.0Constants, Variables, and TensorsEager executionGradient tapeInstructor's Note: This course focuses on breadth rather than depth, with less theory in favor of building more cool stuff. If you are looking for a more theory-dense course, this is not it. Generally, for each of these topics (recommender systems, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, GANs, etc.) I already have courses singularly focused on those topics.Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you in class!WHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:Check out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses, including the free Numpy course)UNIQUE FEATURESEvery line of code explained in detail - email me any time if you disagreeNo wasted time \"typing\" on the keyboard like other courses - let's be honest, nobody can really write code worth learning about in just 20 minutes from scratchNot afraid of university-level math - get important details about algorithms that other courses leave outWho this course is for:Beginners to advanced students who want to learn about deep learning and AI in Tensorflow 2.0Show moreShow less",

We learn about the term artificial intelligence and its origins. We then define the term in the current context.Once these basics are clear, we move on to Understand the various types of Artificial Intelligences like Regression, Classification and Clustering. We also look at reinforced learning and its uses. We talk about each of these in detail along with some real-life examples. We also Take a look back at some real-life artificial intelligence examples like a self-driving car and try to Segment the AI used in this into constituent components like regression classification and clustering.Once equipped with the basic understanding, we define the parts of Artificial Intelligence systems in detail and use real life examples to clarify concepts. The parts like input data, algorithm and output are pretty much common across artificial intelligence models. Having a clear understanding of these as well as their limitations is necessary for strong foundations in the subject.Finally, we develop our own usable AI models. These models are created using no-code method but are completely customizable. In fact, you can even download the code for the AI models that you have created and use it as you would like it. You will define the input, select the algorithm to be used and finally will also evaluate the output produced by the model.The models we create are:Image Detection ModelPose Detection ModelAudio Detection ModelThe course is supposed to be purchased by adults over the age of 18. In case kids want to enroll for the course, course must still be purchased by a parent or guardian and be watched under supervision.Who this course is for:This course has been developed for anyone who wants to get a basic understanding of what Artificial Intelligence is. It's ideal for anyone who has heard the term but doesn't really know what it entails.This course WILL NOT involve coding. You'll develop Artificial Intelligence models using your own dataset but without coding.Show moreShow less",

expertise Questions sent by students to our instructors are answered by our instructors within 48 hours at the latestWhat is machine learning?Machine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning modelWhat is machine learning used for?Machine learning is being applied to virtually every field today That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictionsDoes machine learning require coding?It's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systemsWhat are the limitations of Python?Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popularHow is Python used?Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications You can use Python to create desktop applications Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choices for developing web applications Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile developmentWhat jobs use Python?Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systemsHow do I learn Python on my own?Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your ownWhat is data science?We have more data than ever before But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns This is where data science comes in Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methodsWhat does a data scientist do?Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems This requires several steps First, they must identify a suitable problem Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into productionWhat are the most popular coding languages for data science?Python is the most popular programming language for data science It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available It is also a good beginner language R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis You will want to know either Python or R and SQL SQL is a query language designed for relational databases Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases Those are the three most-used programming languages Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quicklyHow long does it take to become a data scientist?This answer, of course, varies The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn It will also depend on your starting place If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning A better question might be, \"How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist?\" Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the fieldHow can I learn data science on my own?It is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available Start by determining what interests you about data science If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivatedDoes data science require coding?The jury is still out on this one Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill setWhat skills should a data scientist know?A data scientist requires many skills They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science Familiarity with machine learning is also important Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible mannerIs data science a good career?The demand for data scientists is growing We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers The jobs also generally pay well This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you First and foremost, you must think analytically Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for youVideo and Audio Production QualityAll our videos are created/produced as high-quality video and audio to provide you with the best learning experienceYou will be,Seeing clearlyHearing clearlyMoving through the course without distractionsYou'll also get:Lifetime Access to The CourseFast & Friendly Support in the Q&A sectionUdemy Certificate of Completion Ready for DownloadWe offer full support, answering any questionsIf you are ready to learn the “Artificial intelligence with machine learning, deep learning” courseDive in now!

This is not a hands-on course.  We set out to explain all of the fundamental concepts you'll need in plain English. This course is broken into 5 key parts:Part 1: Models, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, & Artificial Intelligence DefinedThis part has a simple mission: to give you a solid understanding of what Machine Learning is.  Mastering the concepts and the terminology is your first step to leveraging them as a capability.  We walk through basic examples to solidify understanding.Part 2: Identifying Use CasesTired of hearing about the same 5 uses for machine learning over and over?  Not sure if ML even applies to you?  Take some expert advice on how you can discover ML opportunities in *your* organization.  Part 3: Qualifying Use CasesOnce you've identified a use for ML, you'll need to measure and qualify that opportunity.  How do you analyze and quantify the advantage of an ML-driven solution?  You do not need to be a data scientist to benefit from this discussion on measurement.  Essential knowledge for business leaders who are responsible for optimizing a business process.Part 4: Building an ML CompetencyKey considerations and tips on building / buying ML and AI solutions. Part 5: Strategic Take-awaysA view on how ML changes the landscape over the long term; and discussion of things you can do *now* to ensure your organization is ready to take advantage of machine learning in the future.Who this course is for:Business leaders, executives, product managers, process owners, service managers, or anyone who is responsible for how their organization operates.Suitable for people with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.Can be a helpful business-point-of-view for aspiring and experienced data scientists.Show moreShow less",

In this course I share my knowledge about KEY and MOST IMPORTANT features of the Computer Networks. No obsolete info! Also I've taught hundreds of students in person in classes because during 7 years I was working as Cisco Certified Systems Instructor (CCSI).This course is all about Computer Networking and Internet. Understand HOW Computer Networks work and learn key Networking ProtocolsEthernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, NAT, DHCP, DNS, private and public IP addresses, subnettingIf those terms are new to you - jump in and you will learn all about them with help of multiple easy-to-grasp diagrams and using multiple practice activities. Most practice activities require just your computer and program called Wireshark.It helps to perform analysis of different protocols and TCP/IP layers headers.Become a master of Computer Networking!If you prepare for the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam, this course is a perfect start for you!This is the most complete Computer Networking Guide here on Udemy that includes tons of practical activities.  You could have zero knowledge about Computer Networking. All will be taught from scratch, from basic to advanced features. If you want to get deep knowledge of Computer Networking this course is for you!We will start by taking about TCP/IP and OSI models. This knowledge is required in order to understand how different hosts communicate with each other and that all communication processes are strictly defined. This is like languages that people need to use to be able to understand each other. Next starting from the Physical layer (bits and bytes) we will move to Data Link layer (Ethernet, MAC addressing and Switching). Next layer will be Network (Routing, IPv4, IPv6, subnetting, network masks, IP addressing, ARP, ICMP). On Transport layer we will discuss in details TCP and UDP protocols and their purpose. On Application layer I will tell you about such important protocols as DHCP and DNS that your computers and mobile phones use very often. Also I will tell you difference between private and public IP addresses and purpose of the NAT.You will also learn how DNS(core of the hierarchical naming structure in the Internet) works and how resolution of each domain name to the IP address happens by involving DNS root nameservers, TLD nameservers and authoritative nameservers.Also it's important to know how routers in the Internet build their routing tables and make routing decisions. That's why I decided to explain you some details about BGP - global routing protocol.In practice sections you will perform multiple practice Networking activities:Install Wireshark and use it for analysis of the networking protocolsAnalyse Ethernet headersUnderstand how DCHP requests and responses help to get IP address assigned to the hostAnalyse structure of the IPv4 headerPractice subnetting Examine ARP cacheExplore IP, DHCP and NAT settings of the Wireless RouterUse nslookup utility to perform DNS and reverse DNS lookups with queries for different types of the DNS records (A, AAAA, TXT, MX)Analyse TCP and UDP headersCheck information about domain names, public IP addresses and ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers)List of the Course Sections and Topics:Introduction to the Computer NetworkingTCP/IP and OSI ModelsBits and BytesEthernetNetwork CharacteristicsSwitches and Data Link LayerRouters and Network LayerIP Addressing and IP PacketsNetworksBinary MathNetwork Masks and SubnettingARP and ICMPTransport Layer - TCP and UDPRoutingNetwork Address TranslationDHCP and DNSDuring this course you will use following Applications to perform different practical activities and analysis of the Protocols and Applications:WiresharkTerminalWeb BrowserWith this course you will get lifetime-long access to almost 200 lectures and tens of practical exercises. After the course you will become a guru of Computer Networking and will be able easily explain what happens when two hosts communicate in the Internet. But most important is that you will UNDERSTAND how Computer Networks work.You will also get 30-days money-back guarantee.

    "long_desc": "DescriptionWe are entering an era in software engineering where we rely on libraries and frameworks to do most of our work. While this is useful and save tremendous dev hours, it creates leaky abstractions that manifest in form of performance degradation, unexpected errors, 100% CPU , network and disk usage, hangs, latency and many other. It becomes difficult to articulate what goes wrong on the backend and how to fix it when engineers don't understand the basic building block of what they are interacting with. Network communication is one of the most critical pieces in backend engineering. And the TCP/IP Internet suite is the basic fundemntal building block of communications that link the frontend to the backend. Any protocol we use eventually gets encapsulated into either a TCP segment or UDP datagram. That packet is wrapped in an IP packet which is placed into a frame and then sent across the network. These layers are important to understand for backend engineers in order to optimize the stack, minimize latency, and increase throughput. What matters  is the true understanding of these pieces and not just memorizing definitions and packet headers to pass an exam. If an engineer truly understood what is happening when their backend API receives an HTTP POST request for example, they will be astonished at how much is happening behind the scenes. They would completely change the way they approach backend API designs, they will try to select the best protocol for the job, and they will tune that protocol to its maximum potential. They will start asking questions about frameworks and libraries that nobody else does. It is those questions that will make them fully utilize those framework to their maximum potential. This course is primarily designed for backend engineers who built applications, services or APIs and want to take their skillset to the next level. If you are a frontend engineer who are interested in the backend and have attempted to build backend apps before this course is also for you. If you are a network engineer who already know the basic fundamentals and want to start building backend applications effectively this course might help you bridge the gapThis course is not designed for those who want to pass network certification tests (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc..)

    "long_desc": "DescriptionTerraform has gained a lot in popularity lately and is the tool you need to master if you are or about to get into a Ops / DevOps role. You typically use a technology like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the provisioning of software. Terraform starts from the same principle, infrastructure as code, but focusses on the automation of the infrastructure itself. Your whole Cloud infrastructure (instances, volumes, networking, IPs) can be described in terraform. In this course you'll learn how to use terraform to automate your infrastructure. I will first show you the basics of terraform and will then explain how to automate infrastructure on AWS using terraform. You can open an AWS account for free to do the labs. I also provide a lot of code examples which you can immediately use to automate your own infrastructure.Update (Oct-2016):Added AWS Autoscaling lecturesAdded Terraform+Packer Jenkins integration lecturesAdded Terraform with Docker on AWS (ECR and ECS)Added Terraform with Jenkins workflow using ECR and ECSUpdate (Dec-2016):Added a lecture about useful terraform commandsAdded a demo on how to use terraform show/graph/taint/untaint/importAdded a lecture and demo about Elastic Beanstalk on AWSUpdate (Jun-2018):Terraform for Windows setup + puttygenInterpolationConditionalsBuilt-in functionsModule development with an ECS + ALB module demoSetting up a hosted Kubernetes cluster using AWS EKSUpdate (Nov-2019):Terraform-0.12 updatesLectures covering new variable approach in terraform-0.12For & For Each loopsUpdate (March-2020):CodePipeline lecturesUpdated lectures with new AWS UIUpdated jenkins-packer-demo demoUpdate (December-2020):Advanced Module developmentLectures and demos covering new Terraform 0.13 featuresTerraform lock file (terraform 0.14)State manipulationUpdate (December-2020):A complete new section on the HashiCorp Terraform Certification has now been added!Update (January-2022):Refactoring modules with the \"moved\" blockCloud Development Kit For Terraform (CDKTF)This course includes english captions.Who this course is for:This course is great if you're in an Ops or DevOps position and you want to learn about automation using terraformShow moreShow less",

Lectures are followed by demos showing how to set up and get started with Docker. The coding exercises that accompany this course will help you practice Docker commands, develop your own images using Dockerfiles, and practice Docker Compose. You will be developing Docker files for different use cases right in your browser. This way, you don’t really need to have your own environment set up to get some hands-on practice. The coding exercises will validate your commands and Dockerfiles and ensure you have written them correctly.And finally, we have assignments to put your skills to the test. You will be given the challenge to solve using the skills you gained during this course. This is a great way to gain real-life project experience and work with the other students in the community to develop a Dockerfile and get feedback for your work. The assignment will push you to research and develop your own Docker images.Our tools, courses, and resources will help you improve your Docker skills and help you gain a true understanding of the program.Who this course is for:System AdministratorsCloud Infrastructure EngineersDevelopersShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionCI, CD and DevOps have taken over the software development world by storm. Most companies today realize that the practices of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) will yield tremendous benefits like increased business revenue and faster time-to-market. The demand for these skills has been steadily rising over the last few years.There are a plethora of tools available in the CI/CD/DevOps landscape today. Implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment with these tools and frameworks can help us immensely in modernizing our software development lifecycle. It catches us bugs early and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost for software development in startups and enterprise alike.But before getting into tools and frameworks, it is important that you get a holistic picture of CI / CD and DevOps. For this, you need to understand where we started from - the old school traditional software development cycle. We will pick holes in the old model, identify pain points and learn how CI / CD and DevOps evolved, one step at a time. Once you build a rock solid foundation using this course, you can move on to more specific tool oriented courses.If you are thinking about moving on to CI/CD/DevOps from your old school software development model, this course is for you.

This course will NOT make you a GitLab CI / DevOps expertA lot of courses promise you will become an expert. Becoming an expert in any tool comes with time and hard work. It simply does not make sense to promise something like that. It will not be honest. This is a course designed for beginners. Learning to build pipelines is a try-and-error process that can be very frustrating. You need to understand the tools you use and how GitLab can support your needs. In the end, GitLab is just a tool. What I will try is to explain to you the basics and offer you enough practice opportunities so that you can apply what you learn easily in your own projects as well.

    "long_desc": "DescriptionApple, Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, Tesla, Workday... what do all these great companies have in common?They all use DevOps to continuously build and release software. (Don't take my word for it; stop reading now and go put \"devops\" into a LinkedIn job search.) In this Azure DevOps Fundamentals course, Microsoft Certified Trainer and bestselling Udemy instructor Brian Culp guides students on a hands-on tour of Azure DevOps -- Microsoft's cloud-based, open-source tool to help organizations manage development teams,  code, and application deployments.Best of all, Brian understands that students taking a Fundamentals course may not yet be familiar with all the vocabulary. This course makes no assumptions about prior exposure to the overwhelming set of terms and technologies that are part of the DevOps landscape... terms like Agile, Scrum, VS Code, App Containers, Commits, Code Requests, Sprints, Unit Testing, Code Artifacts, and literally dozens of others that live at the place where your Development and Operations teams meet.In Azure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners, we take one small step at a time in our journey. It's not a data dump. Instead, the course provides each building block the proper context at the time it's needed. In addition, you'll build your understanding with hands-on guidance using the essential Azure DevOps tools: Boards, Repos, Pipelines, and Test Plans. Everything that needs a definition is defined along the way.Brian has been teaching people about Microsoft solutions for over 15 years, and some of his courses have been selected by Microsoft as their official training for Office 365 Administrators. Now, he brings that same expertise to some of the highest-rated courses on Udemy.There's a reason for the hundreds of five-star reviews.\"Excellent content!  Just what I was looking for to enhance productivity at the office.\" -Paige Popejoy\"Great personality and explained things well. Felt like he was at my desk explaining it to me.\"  -William Potts \"I can't believe how much I learned. The instructor is great and the lessons were so easy to follow.\" Sherie L.\"Very precise, clear and constructive.\" -Forent Sidler\"Perfect.\"  -Yvonne BeloAzure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners is perfect for IT professionals who have heard the term DevOps, but want some hands-on experience, or for project managers and product owners who want to better understand a CI/CD workflow used by development teams.It's even great for the stone-cold noobs out there (we all are at one point, after all) who just want to be able to see if DevOps might be a good career fit.  You'll learn by watching and listening, but you'll also learn by doing. By the second lesson, you'll have configured your first DevOps organization. By the time you've finished, you'll have deployed an app into an Azure container, and will have gained additional confidence and expertise about topics like these:Managing dev teams using Azure BoardsMapping work items to your organization's Agile or Scrum processes Setting up Git-based workflows in Azure ReposConnecting to existing code repos in GitHubBuilding code every time a commit is saved to a Master branchDeploying a new code artifact when new builds are readyPerforming tests of code using Azure Test PlansPlus confidence to integrate other tools (Docker, Maven, etc) into your team's DevOps implementationBest of all, you become more valuable as companies all over the world scramble - and compete - for workers who understand DevOps. (You did do that LinkedIn search, correct?)And as always, you get ongoing support. (Brian and the team answers all student questions, usually within one business day). Plus, you're always covered by Udemy's refund policy.Enroll now, and discover where your own DevOps journey can lead.

It is the underlying building block of many defense mechanisms, systems, and protocols.  Without crypto, we will not be able to safely conduct many things on the Internet, such as web browsing, online banking, working remotely, etc. Without crypto, blockchain and cryptocurrency will not exist. In this course, we systematically study the basic principles of cryptography.  In particular, we focus on the three essential pillars of cryptography, including secret-key encryption, one-way hash function, and public-key cryptography. We study how they work and how they are used in the real-world applications. We also look at the risks they face, and how these risks are mitigated in the real world. Furthermore, we study the common mistakes people make when using crypto algorithms and protocols. We show how these mistakes can be exploited in attacks. The course emphasizes hands-on learning. For each topic covered, students not only learn the theory, they also get to work on the hands-on exercises developed by the instructor. These exercises are called SEED labs, and they are being used by over 1000 institutes worldwide. The course is based on the widely-adopted textbook written by the instructor. The title of the book is \"Computer & Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach\".Who this course is for:Undergraduate and graduate students studying cybersecurityAnyone who is interested in learning the cryptography basics, especially the applied aspects of cryptoAnyone who is interested in gaining a deeper understanding of how various crypto-based systems workAnyone who is interested in learning how blockchain and cryptocurrencies workShow moreShow less",

Jason is easy to follow, listen to, and understand during your study period (I sit for hours listening and taking notes and replaying the section) (Mark Guillen, 5 stars)Just passed my security+ today! Dion's course was excellent. It was all I needed, and I took his practice tests I also purchased. The only thing I think would help other testers is more sophisticated and harder performance-based questions as I experienced ones today that were pretty tough and required more hands-on experience. Overall, though completely worth the money. (Duran navarro, 5 stars)The course is very informative and good for people that has no knowledge about cybersecurity so far. It teaches us about the harm caused by attacks and how to prevent them. I would suggest everyone to take this course, even if they don't wan the certificate from Comptia.  (Mahmoud Choumar, 5 stars)Jason is a great pedagogue. He is thorough and amiable. The course has very minimal errors and you can tell he is very strict with the format of his lessons. I had very few questions during the lectures and only experience one issue throughout the whole experience. I will definitely buy more courses from him. I also bought the voucher from his website to get the retake for only 100 bucks! Good job Dion Training! Keep up the great job! (Victor Cabrales, 5 stars)Passed the exam in December of 2022 using this course - FIRST TRY!! This course gave the back bone of everything I needed to pass the Sec. + exam. When the time came to study up a day or two before the actual exam, I used all the practice quizzes/tests from the CompTIA Sec. + study book. Seems thoughtless or stupid to not use the book for actual studying, but I found I learn slightly better in a class environment and this course/videos allowed me that. Thank you for this course and I look forward to many more in the future! Honestly, I haven't taken an ACTUAL exam in years - many years. If I can do it, you all can too! Good luck and God speed! (Nathaniel Shumaker, 5 stars)Upon completion of this course, you will earn 21 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.Who this course is for:IT ProfessionalsEntry-Level Security PersonnelMilitary PersonnelGovernment EmployeesSecurity ConsultantsStudents and Recent GraduatesShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionCISSP is the gold standard for security certifications. It covers the breadth of information security’s deep technical and managerial concepts. Learning to effectively design, engineer, and manage the overall security posture of an organization. This course covers Domain 1 - Security and Risk Management. This domain is one of the most important domains in the CISSP exam. It lays the foundation, covering security concepts that all the other domains build upon. Understanding exactly what security means and the core concepts around assessing and managing the wide array of risks we face is fundamental to every domain in the CISSP. Domain 2 - Asset Security. An asset is anything we value. When we have highly valued assets, such as sensitive data, securing those assets throughout their lifecycle is paramount. We will learn about data standards, classification, regulations, retention, and controls to protect organizational value. Domain 3 - Security Engineering. Engineering is about understanding and designing systems that work. Security is a fundamental part of any well-designed system. This domain will help you understand the engineering lifecycle and various models and security components required in data structures and physical facilities. We also learn how cryptography fits in to information security. Domain 4 - Communication and Network Security. Information is not just stored; it is also transmitted and must be secured in transit. Understanding networking models, protocols, hardware components, and possible attack vectors is vital to information security. It is one of the most important domains on the CISSP exam. Domain 5 - Identity and Access Management. Controlling who can access valuable resources can lead to proper confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A CISSP must understand mechanisms and techniques to verify a subject’s authenticity before authorizing access. They must be able to assure that only proper interactions have occurred and mitigate potential attacks. Domain 6 - Security Assessment and Testing. Understanding the effectiveness of your security measures is vital. As you collect and review logs, verify software development security, and undergo security audits and certification you can have some assurance and insight into your security status and needs. Domain 7- Security Operations. From incident response that involves investigation of evidence to facility access management and disaster recovery planning, testing, and implementation, this domain requires putting security principles and concepts into practice. Domain 8 - Security in the Software Development Life Cycle. Many of the most publicized security issues have stemmed from flaws in the software code. While a CISSP does not have to be a software developer, they must understand and be able to communicate software development security needs. In this domain you will learn important terminology and concepts of software development.Who this course is for:Network, IT, Server Managers and Security Administrators who want to earn a CISSP CertificateShow moreShow less",

Whether they are a Fortune 500 technology company or a sole proprietor landscaping company, software is integral to businesses large and small. Software provides a means to track employees, customers, inventory, and scheduling. Data moves from a myriad of systems, networks, and software providing insights to businesses looking to stay competitive. Some of that software used is built within the organization or it is purchased and integrated. What this means is that every organization, regardless of size and industry, has a software need. It enables organizations to move quickly and stay ahead of their competition.Because of this, we need more help in developing secure software. That’s where this course can help!This course will familiarize you with the common vulnerabilities that plague developed code as outlined in publications like the OWASP Top 10 and SANS Top 25. You will understand what type of development behaviors lead to vulnerabilities and how to avoid those behaviors when creating secure code. You will learn how to perform a threat model on development features to understand what threats could impact your code, where they come from and how to mitigate them. You will also review and operate analysis tools that are available to developers in order to analyze their code and discover vulnerabilities, allowing you to correct them early in the development life cycle. Finally you will understand how application security fits in an overall cyber security program.Who this course is for:Software developers interested in developing more secure software.Security practitionersSoftware and security engineering leadersCyber security professionalsShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionSecurity is paramount for any application. Cryptography occurs all across software fields: it protects all HTTPS traffic between browsers, encrypts phone storage against prying eyes, and can even hide files inside other files through a technique called steganography. This course is for developers looking to design a system that uses cryptography, rather than designing new algorithms. Most developers simply need to put the right pieces together to make their own system work.In this course, you will break down the concepts behind cryptography into simple lessons, covering terminology, algorithms, standards, and encryption/decryption techniques. We will also walk through how cryptographic systems are hacked to bypass (rather than break) their cryptographic capabilities. The course answers questions such as:What is cryptography used for?What are keys and where do they go?Why do networked systems sometimes give certificate validation errors?If I need to encrypt something, how should I do that?By the end of this course, you will recognize cryptographic problems and understand the right knowledge to apply a verifiable solution.About the AuthorErik Costlow ran Oracle’s Java Root Certificate program, coordinating efforts with many cryptographic organizations. He is an experienced software security expert focused on program analysis and runtime instrumentation to detect security issues and provide useful guidance on fixing any security issues.Who this course is for:This video course is for developers whose applications require encryption, or integration with an external cryptographic system.Java developers building standard applications that require encryption, developers looking to understand flaws in cryptographic systems, and developers who do not want flaws in their cryptographic systems will benefit from this course.Show moreShow less",

Learn how to encrypt data, evaluate and compare encryption methods, and how to attack them. This video course starts by showing you how to encrypt and evaluate your data. You are also walked through various data encryption methods—such as obfuscation, hashing, and strong encryption—and how you can attack them. You will then learn how to make hashes and crack them, and understand why they are so different. You will also learn how to use three NIST-recommended systems: AES, SHA, and RSA. Towards the end of the course, you will master common errors in encryption and how to exploit them.This course uses Python 2.7, while not the latest version available, it provides relevant and informative content for legacy users of Python.About the AuthorSam Bowne has been teaching computer networking and security classes at City College, San Francisco since 2000.

    "long_desc": "DescriptionWelcome to the bestselling quantum computing course on Udemy!Quantum Computing is the next wave of the software industry. Quantum computers are exponentially faster than classical computers of today. Problems that were considered too difficult for computers to solve, such as simulation of protein folding in biological systems, and cracking RSA encryption, are now possible through quantum computers.How fast are Quantum Computers? A 64-bit quantum computer can process 36 billion billion bytes of information in each step of computation. Compare that to the 8 bytes that your home computer can process in each step of computation!Companies like Google, Intel, IBM, and Microsoft are investing billions in their quest to build quantum computers. If you master quantum computing now, you will be ready to profit from this technology revolution.This course teaches quantum computing from the ground up. The only background you need is 12th grade level high-school Math and Physics. IMPORTANT: You must enjoy Physics and Math to get the most out of this course. This course is primarily about analyzing the behavior of quantum circuits using Math and Quantum Physics. While everything you need to know beyond 12th grade high school science is explained here, you must be aware that Quantum Physics is an extremely difficult subject. You might frequently need to stop the video and replay the lesson to understand it. QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNINGIt appears that the killer-app for quantum computing will be machine learning and artificial intelligence.Quantum machine learning algorithms provide a significant speed-up in training. This speed-up can result in more accurate predictions.While understanding quantum algorithms requires mastery of complex math, using  quantum machine learning is relatively simple. Qiskit encapsulates machine learning algorithms inside an API that mimics the popular Scikit-Learn machine-learning toolkit. So you can use quantum machine learning almost as easily as you would traditional ML!Quantum machine learning can be applied in the back-end to train models, and those trained models can be used in consumer gadgets. This means that quantum machine learning might enhance your everyday life even if quantum computers remain expensive!COURSE OUTLINEWe begin by learning about basic math. You might have forgotten the math you learned in high-school. I will review linear algebra, probability, Boolean algebra, and complex numbers.Quantum physics is usually considered unapproachable because it deals with the behavior of extremely tiny particles. But in this course, I will explain quantum physics through the behavior of polarized light. Light is an everyday phenomenon and you will be able to understand it easily.Next we learn about quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography is provably unbreakable. I will explain the BB84 quantum protocol for secure key sharing.Then we will learn about the building-blocks of quantum programs which are quantum gates.To understand how quantum gates work, we will study quantum superposition and quantum entanglement in depth.We will apply what we have learned by constructing quantum circuits using Microsoft Q# (QSharp) and IBM Qiskit. For those of you who don't know the Python programming language, I will provide a crisp introduction of what you need to know.We will begin with simple circuits and then progress to a full implementation of the BB84 quantum cryptography protocol in Qiskit.We will learn how to use Qiskit's implementation of Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.The killer-app for quantum computing is quantum machine learning.To understand quantum machine learning, we must first learn how classical machine learning works. I provide a crisp introduction to classical machine learning and neural networks (deep learning).Finally, we will train a Quantum Support Vector Machine on real-world data and use it to make predictions.For a better learning experience, open the transcript panel.     You will see a small \"transcript\" button at the bottom-right of the video player on Udemy's website. If you click this button, the transcript of the narration will be displayed. The transcripts for all the videos have been hand-edited for accuracy. Opening the transcript panel will help you understand the concepts better.     If you missed an important concept, then you can click on text in the transcript panel to return directly to the part you want to repeat. Conversely, if you already understand the concept being presented, you can click on text in the transcript panel to skip ahead in the video.Enroll today and join the quantum revolution!

    "long_desc": "DescriptionHello and welcome to my new course The Dummies guide to Practical Quantum Computing with IBM Qiskit. Our current classical computing technology is based on bits or binary digits 1 and 0 . 1 for ON and 0 OFF. Even though it have two states, a bit can exist in only one state at a time. Just like a coin having two faces head and tail. NOTE: In classical computers a programmer can simply WRITE HIGH LEVEL CODE AND RUN it. But for Quantum Computers we have to DESIGN CIRCUITS for performing specific tasks.Quantum computing concept is entirely different from classical one. It use the quantum mechanical property of tiny sub atomic particles like electrons to perform computation. Instead of 1 and 0, a qubit or quantum bit uses the spin position 'up' and 'down' of electrons. But unlike bits, qubits can exist in both state simultaneously. Like a coin keeps on spinning, we could say it is having equal probability for both head and tail. Or it is both head and tail at the same time.For example consider an 1 bit calculation of finding the best path. 0 means right and 1 means left. A classical computer with a single bit have to first set bit to 0 to go to left path and later 1 to go to right path to find the best path. But a quantum computer with a single qubit can go through both the path simultaneously and arrive at a solution in just only half the time. As the number of qubits increases, this speed increases exponentially compared to classical computers. Computations like data analytic, artificial intelligence which require large parallel processing ability can perform calculations in matter of milli-seconds where it now takes ages to complete.Even though its not going to replace our laptops or mobile phones, Quantum computers will be able to solve these road blocks of traditional computers in data processing. Recently Google announced it has a quantum computer that is 100 million times faster than any classical computer in its lab. The first section of our course from sessions 1 to 6, we are learning essential details about quantum mechanics, and quantum bits which will start with an introduction to quantum mechanics. We will try to have a quick understanding about the difference between quantum mechanics and classical physics, dual nature of particles, double slit experiment, superposition, quantum entanglement etc in the most simplest way of explanation.In the next session we will discuss about the difference between classical bits and quantum bits called qubits. Creating, representing and processing a classical bit. Then how a qubit is generated, what's inside the qubit, how data is represented in qubit and what makes it faster than classical bits.Then we will see in details how a qubit is created and how its retaining its information. We will also discuss the structure of a quantum computer and the way qubits are dealt within it.Then we will learn about scalars and vectors. How vectors and matrices are used to represent the state of a quantum bit. About representing the qubit as Ket vectors and matrices. We will also learn basic matrix operations.After learning about classical bits and qubits, we can now proceed with gates. At first we will learn about classical gates, its working and also different types of classical gates and their truth tables.In the next session, we will learn about the popular quantum frameworks by leading companies researching on quantum computers, their merits and demerits.Having all concepts clear, now we can proceed with the practical part of our course. We will at first setup our computer by installing python environment. Its made easy by installing python distribution called anaconda. Then we will proceed with installing and testing qiskit, the quantum framework by IBMOnce we have qiskit in our computer and the quantum simulator running, we will be coding our first quantum circuit using the simple quantum gate called the Pauli x gate. Later we will try customizing the input and output to the Pauli x gate and verify the operations.Once we verified in simulator, its time we can try that in a real quantum computer. IBM provides access to their number of quantum computers located in research facilities around the world. Using IBM quantum experience interface we can simply create our Pauli x gate circuit to work in a real quantum computer and get output.Then we will check how we can represent matrices as state vectors using dirac notation. We will see how Pauli x gate matrices will be represented as a state vector.Similarly we will proceed with Pauli Y gate. We will check the state vector and try with the operations in our qiskit simulator at first and then implement it in the IBM real quantum computer.Like that, another gate called the Pauli Z gate. For this one also we will learn about the operations in our qiskit simulator at first and then implement it in real quantum computer.In the next session, we will learn about the Eigen value and Eigen vectors of our already learnt Pauli x, y and z gates.After that, we will learn about a new gate called as the Hadamard gate or the H gate. This gate is capable of generating superposition from a classical qubit. We will have an introduction about the operations of H gate. Then we will implement the H gate in our qiskit simulator. We will check the bloch sphere and histogram representation using qiskit. Using H gate we will also try creating few custom circuits in which we will try to replicate an X gate operations only using the H and Z gates. In the next circuit we will check the phenomenon of collapsing the superposition when we measure the qubit.Then we will try the Hadamard gate in an IBM quantum computer.After H gate we will take few quick sessions dealing with few more gates. The first one called as the R Phi gate. Then we will check two more gates called as the S and T gates. And finally will deal with the U and I gates. We will check the transition matrix and operations of those gates.Those were gates with single qubit operations. Now we will proceed with gates that are capable of multi-qubit operations. Before that, we will learn about representing multi-qubits and its states. We will be using a package called qiskit-notebook for representing the multi-qiskit state vector. At first we will try to create a multi-qubit circuit using single qubit gates. At first we will try with X and H gates combined to form the circuit. And later we will try using two qubits and a single gate.After that we will proceed with a real multi-qubit gate called as CNOT gate or the Controlled NOT gate. We will learn more about CNOT gate, the truth table and its operations. At first we will try the CNOT gate with classical qubits. We will implement it in qiskit. Later we will try the CNOT gate with only one superposition qubit and after that with both superposition qubits.Then we will proceed with implementing CNOT gate in the Real quantum computer from IBM. We can also create identity circuits using CNOT gate. Using these equivalence circuit we can mimic operations of other gates which cannot be performed in a real quantum computer. At first we will create an identity circuit using a CNOT gate wrapped with H gates so that it will act like a CNOT gate placed in opposite direction.Then we will try another equivalence circuit using a CNOT gate in between Hadamard gates which will generate operations of a Controlled Z gate or CZ gate. Like that we will create an equivalence circuit for another theoretical gate called as the CY gate or the Controlled Y gate.There is another gate called as the SWAP gate. Like the name indicates, it can swap the qubit states between each other. We will also create circuit identity or circuit equivalence for swap gate. Similarly for another gate called the Tiffoli gate, we will create circuit identity or circuit equivalence for tiffoli gate and we will implement that circuit in qiskit.And that's all with gates, we will now proceed with learning an important algorithm called as the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm or DJ algorithm which demonstrates quantum parallelism. The underlying mathematics of this algorithm is very complex and we are just trying learn it in just a very shallow manner. At first we will see the DJ problem that the algorithm is dealing with and later we will learn about the algorithm design. We will implement it in qiskit later and will verify the results.We will then proceed with discussing about two interesting technologies. The first one called as QKD or Quantum key distribution which utilizes the unique properties of quantum  systems to generate and distribute cryptographic key. Quantum cryptography also uses the same physics principles to communicate virtually non-hackable data over a dedicated communications link. Then we will discuss about Quantum tele-portation which is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away.Overall this will be a nice course for a beginner who are fascinated about quantum computing and want to learn more about quantum computing. Actual quantum computing is all about complex boring mathematics and formulas which I have tried my maximum to avoid convert it in a very simple way to make it understandable to a beginner. In this course we are strictly following the IBM Qiskit documentation and text book. Almost all of the illustrations and examples used in this course are from the IBM qiskit documentation website which you may refer for further learning from this point.Quantum computers could help the development of new breakthroughs in science, medications, machine learning, material science, finance which helps mankind to become the best civilization in the whole universe. In fact quantum computer is so powerful that no one knows how to use its true potential and till now no quantum algorithm is perfect. The hardware and code are still in its development stage providing great opportunities in future for quantum computing professionals.  That's all about the topics which are currently included in this quick course. The code, and jupyter notebook files used in this course has been uploaded and shared in a folder. I will include the link to download them in the last session or the resource section of this course. You are free to use the code in your projects with no questions asked.Also after completing this course, you will be provided with a course completion certificate which will add value to your portfolio.So that's all for now, see you soon in the class room. Happy learning and have a great time.References and Credits:IBM's qiskit  learnIBM's qiskit textbookIBM's qiskit documentationblog cloudflare - the-quantum-menacetowardsdatascience demystifying quantum gates one qubit at a time 54404ed80640wikipedia - Quantum_logic_gatejonathan-hui qc quantum computing series 10ddd7977abdyoutube - Coding with Qiskityoutube - Veritasium, a much simplified explanation to every complex quantum conceptsVery much inspired by works and articles of Professor Andrea Morello.

Prior to this course, I thought I would never be able to understand quantum mechanics. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone that is interested in learning quantum mechanics.“ - Maximus Akrem Nwider\"I have learned more theory here than in a semester in a university course. The information is incredibly well organized. I cannot express the insanely good quality of this course.\" - AaronThis course is for everyone: beginner to expert! We will cover the whole band width of quantum mechanics starting from the initial experimental observations and ending up with relativistic quantum theory.Quantum mechanics is arguably among the most fascinating fields of science. It has made numerous appearances in modern pop-culture and is present in our everyday lives. Still, it is also very challenging to get a grasp at this topic - even understanding the most fundamental concepts can be very difficult without instructions. However, I think that this most fascinating field of science is often taught either too vague or with a too strong focus on the mathematics. Instead of watching random Youtube videos or going through hundred of hours of university courses, I think that Udemy courses are a nice platform for purposeful learning. You are kindly invited to join this carefully prepared course that will teach you the 101 of quantum physics.Why me?My name is Börge and I am a postdoc working as a scientist in quantum theory. Due to my expertise in the field (more than 10 years), I know which topics are most important and which parts can be cut short (especially the very dry parts). I have not forgotten the time when I learned about quantum physics and still remember the problems that I and other students had. I have refined my advisor skills as a tutor of Bachelor, Master and PhD students in theoretical physics.This course is for you if you ...... have ever wondered what is the big deal with quantum physics... want to know why we need quantum physics ... want to learn the methods how to actually calculate quantum problems like the tunnel effect... want to walk comfortably in the quantum world without being totally overwhelmed by its difficult language... have interest in popular physics phenomena like quantum computing or superconductivity and want to understand their core ideas and relations to quantum mechanics... are about to attend a university course... if you have already attend a university course and want to learn what comes nextor... if you simply want to have a carefully condensed refresher before your exams :-)Who this course is for:Beginner: Everyone who wants to know how the quantum world works and is not too affraid of the mathematics.Advanced: Science students who want to refresh their quantum mechanics course and want to know what comes next.Programmer and engineers working on quantum computing: Here you will learn the theory behind quantum physics.Show moreShow less",

This is going to be the new era of computation/ physics. Enroll for an enriching career in Quantum Research and learn Pythonic Libraries like Qiskit to operate with Quantum Gates and Quantum Circuits in depth. A fantastic computing era to join. In this course will see how to generate quantum circuits using quantum gates like CNOT, Hadamard, SWAP etc. This course sets the correct path in order to study Quantum Cryptography in depth and in the later series will move towards Quantum Machine Learning and libraries of Google like CIRQ. Will see how to handle quantum circuits using quantum as well as classical channel. Applications of Quantum Teleportation and Super Dense Coding and a very important theorem called as No Cloning Theorem.  Quantum computing is the use of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.In the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero. In quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to density operators. This is the technically rigorous mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates, but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler.Who this course is for:DevelopersData ScientistsMachine Learning EngineerArtificial Intelligence ResearchersData EngineerResearchersScientistsPhysicistsMathematiciansDeep LearningDeep Learning EngineersReinforcement LearningProgrammersPython DevelopersShow moreShow less",

Do you remember the last time you had trouble getting a product to work, like when using a new piece of technology for the first time? Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a key skill for professionals who seek to engage customers, users, audiences, and subscribers with powerful, well-designed products and experiences that leave a lasting impact. In this course, you will learn to master the fundamentals of human-computer interaction by exploring user experience design and research with users to discover actionable insights and achieve better results. The course, designed by nationally recognized expert Professor Ray Lutzky, PhD, is an introduction for product designers, software engineers, and anyone who wants to create better experiences for their users. This course is adapted from graduate-level university courses in HCI, digital media management, interface design, and user experience design taught by Dr. Lutzky at Cornell University, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Southern California. Topics include understanding affordances, ethics of user research, research techniques such as interviewing and usability testing, developing personas, persuasive technologies, wireframes, prototypes, and more. The course includes quizzes to assess learning at the end of each section, and activities to help you build your own user experiences through the application of techniques covered in the course, culminating in the design of your own user experience design plan.Who this course is for:Beginner-level designers , engineers, product managers interested in creating outstanding user experiences.Show moreShow less",

I believe however that technology and it's theory are for everyone. So I designed this course to teach each topic in a variety of easy to digest ways. Through these multiple reinforcing steps, I believe anyone can follow along and succeed! Why is the Theory of Programming Important? Understanding Computer Science theory is what sets apart Great programmers from average ones. Programming theory is something that transcends a single programming language. It gives you skills and techniques you can apply to any programming language you touch. Learning the theory behind programming is just as important, if not more important than learning a singular programming language like Java or C++.Programming is all about problem solving. Analyzing a problem, and being able to figure out a way that a computer can help with that problem. Computer Science is the practice of this analysis process. It goes over the techniques and knowledge necessary to design efficient and sustainable code. So if you want to begin setting yourself apart from the average programmers, this is the course for you! Enroll Now and you'll Learn: Binary Number SystemN NotationBig O NotationHow to Analyze a ProgramArrays and their AdvantagesNodes and their ImportanceLinked Lists and their Advantages and ImplementationsStacks implemented with Arrays and Linked ListsQueues Implemented with Arrays and Linked ListsVarious Sorting Algorithms and Their ComparisionsTrees and Binary Search TreesAnd Much Much More! My GuaranteeI am so confident you will enjoy this course, I offer a 100% 30-day money-back guarantee through Udemy. If you are not happy with your purchase, I have no problem with giving your money back! Are You Ready to Get Started? I will be waiting for you inside the course! Remember, this is an online course, so you can take it at your own pace. Are you busy right now? That's okay.

Computers and computer programs are everywhere in our everyday lives. We use software in smartphones, ATMs and even household appliances that we are able to control with our smartphones. A lot of people are confused and don't really know how all of this actually worksThis compact course will take you from zero knowledge to having a solid understanding of the basic concepts of computer science and programming languages.To keep the course interesting and entertaining, we use a lot of examples to explain the individual topics. Amongst many other things we will learn about the importance of algorithms and how we can create one and why they are incredibly important. We will also learn about different approaches to programming such as imperative, declarative and object oriented programming. We're going to give you real world examples outside of code and computer programs to make sure everybody is able to understand what we are talking about.At the end of this course you will have a fundamental understanding of the most important concepts of computer science and programming and can try your luck on an easy test exercise. The course also contains a kind of glossary where we've listed definitions and explanations for the most important terms so you always have them at your fingertips.So if you always wanted to know how computers actually work, what a programmer does and how we are using computers to develop our own programs join us in this course!Who this course is for:Programming BeginnersPeople who are interested in the topic of Computer Science and ProgrammingShow moreShow less",

And if we are, what is the difference?What are my strengths?What are my weaknesses? Is there anything else I can do about them?What secrets does my DNA hold?.This course is the first one in Living Your Design series. If you’ve ever asked yourself these questions, then you’ve heard about Human Design system that answers these (and many other) questions in the fullest. This phenomenal system of self-knowing and self-understanding arrived in 1987 and transformed lives of so many, mine included.And here I’d like to point out that it’s a self-knowing, not self-improvement.Human Design shows us that we already came into this world as perfect beings.For various reasons we’ve distanced ourselves from our nature.Living your Design, your true Self helps you to go back to your nature.This is your Love Story of going back home, to yourself, to self-acceptance, self-love in the most practical way.Fall in love with yourself again through learning WHO YOU TRULY ARE.Fall in love with your loved ones all over again through learning WHO THEY REALLY ARE.The time has come.In this course we are going into the basics, and learning about Type and Non-Self Themes in Human Design. Apart from that, there are a lot of practices for living your Type, your Human Design.P.S.Human Design is called a New Astrology, and with deep respect to Astrology, I'll just add they are very different because Human Design doesn't have a fatalistic element. It gives you knowledge of the tools you were given in this life time, and there are so many ways you can use those tools - the freedom is yours. If you value your freedom, if you want to find it, Human Design is the way to go!Who this course is for:anyone who wants to really know who they are (and fall in love with yourself)anyone who is interested in self-healing, meditation, happiness, awareness, hypnotherapy, yoga, regression, psychology, human behavior, coaching, mentoring - you will find this course very useful in your personal life as much as your professional one.anyone who wants to improve and have fulfilling relationships - with yourself and othersif you've tried every possible tool and nothing else worksif you like profound things which are based on esoterical knowledge as much as on the sciencehome stay momsyoga students and teacherscoaches, astrologers, psychologists, hypnotherapists, hr specialists, anyone who is working with peopletravelerseveryone in a relationshipeveryone who has a child/children+21enterpreneursShow moreShow less",
